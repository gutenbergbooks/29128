<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>Across lots to the Brumble farm came the
dusty apparition of a boy, a tousle-headed,
freckle-faced, gaunt-eyed little fellow, clad in a
sort of combination suit fashioned from a pair
of overalls and a woman&#8217;s shirtwaist. In search
of &#8220;Miss M&#8217;ri,&#8221; he looked into the kitchen, the
henhouse, the dairy, and the flower garden. Not
finding her in any of these accustomed places, he
stood still in perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss M&#8217;ri!&#8221; rang out his youthful, vibrant
treble.</p>
<p>There was a note of promise in the pleasant
voice that came back in subterranean response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, David, in the cellar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad set down the tin pail he was carrying
and eagerly sped to the cellar. His fondest
hopes were realized. M&#8217;ri Brumble, thirty odd
years of age, blue of eye, slightly gray of hair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and sweet of heart, was lifting the cover from
the ice-cream freezer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, David Dunne, you came in the nick of
time,&#8221; she said, looking up with kindly eyes.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just frozen. I&#8217;ll dish you up some now, if
you will run up to the pantry and fetch two
saucers&ndash;&ndash;biggest you can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fleetly David footed the stairs and returned
with two soup plates.</p>
<p>&#8220;These were the handiest,&#8221; he explained apologetically
as he handed them to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing,&#8221; promptly reassured M&#8217;ri,
transferring a heaping ladle of yellow cream to
one of the plates. &#8220;Easy to eat out of, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but you are giving me a whole lot,&#8221; he
said, watching her approvingly and encouragingly.
&#8220;I hope you ain&#8217;t robbing yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I always make plenty,&#8221; she replied,
dishing a smaller portion for herself. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
enough for our dinner and some for you to carry
home to your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had any since last Fourth of
July,&#8221; he observed in plaintive reminiscence as
they went upstairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, David Dunne, how you talk! You
just come over here whenever you feel like eating
ice cream, and I&#8217;ll make you some. It&#8217;s no
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat down on the west, vine-clad porch to
enjoy their feast in leisure and shade. M&#8217;ri had
never lost her childish appreciation of the delicacy,
and to David the partaking thereof was
little short of ecstasy. He lingered longingly
over the repast, and when the soup plate would
admit of no more scraping he came back with a
sigh to sordid cares.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother couldn&#8217;t get the washing done no-ways
to-day. She ain&#8217;t feeling well, but you can
have the clothes to-morrow, sure. She sent you
some sorghum,&#8221; pointing to the pail.</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri took the donation into the kitchen. When
she brought back the pail it was filled with eggs.
Not to send something in return would have
been an unpardonable breach of country etiquette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother said your hens weren&#8217;t laying,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes brightened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss M&#8217;ri; these will come in
good. Our hens won&#8217;t lay nor set. Mother says
they have formed a union. But I &#8217;most forgot
to tell you&ndash;&ndash;when I came past Winterses, Ziny
told me to ask you to come over as soon as you
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Zine has got one of her low spells,&#8221;
said Barnabas Brumble, who had just come up
from the barn. &#8220;Most likely Bill&#8217;s bin gittin&#8217;
tight agin. He&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; interrupted his sister hastily. &#8220;Bill
has quit drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s allers a-quittin&#8217;. Trouble with Bill is,
he can&#8217;t stay quit. I see him yesterday comin&#8217;
down the road zig-zaggin&#8217; like a rail fence. Fust
she knows, she&#8217;ll hev to be takin&#8217; washin&#8217; to support
him. Sometimes I think &#8217;t would be a good
idee to let him git sent over the road onct. Mebby
&#8217;t would learn him a lesson&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped short, noticing the significant look
in M&#8217;ri&#8217;s eyes and the two patches of color
spreading over David&#8217;s thin cheeks. He recalled
that four years ago the boy&#8217;s father had
died in state prison.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go right over to Zine&#8217;s,&#8221; he
added abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till after dinner. We&#8217;ll have it
early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hev it now,&#8221; suggested Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; ejaculated David. &#8220;It&#8217;s only half-past
ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could eat it now jest as well as I could at
twelve,&#8221; argued the philosophical Barnabas.
&#8220;Jest as leaves as not.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were no iron-clad rules in this comfortable
household, especially when Pennyroyal, the
help, was away.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented M&#8217;ri with alacrity. &#8220;If
I am going to do anything, I like to do it right
off quick and get it over with. You stay,
David, if you can eat dinner so early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can,&#8221; he assured her, recalling his
scanty breakfast and the freezer of cream that
was to furnish the dessert. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you get
it, Miss M&#8217;ri.&#8221;</p>
<p>He brought a pail of water from the well,
filled the teakettle, and then pared the potatoes
for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When will Jud and Janey get their dinner?&#8221;
he asked Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;They kerried their dinner to-day. The scholars
air goin&#8217; to hev a picnic down to Spicely&#8217;s
grove. How comes it you ain&#8217;t to school,
Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to help my mother with the washing,&#8221;
he replied, a slow flush coming to his face.
&#8220;She ain&#8217;t strong enough to do it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on airth kin you do about a washin&#8217;,
Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can draw the water, turn the wringer, hang
up the clothes, empty the tubs, fetch and carry
the washings, and mop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas puffed fiercely at his pipe for a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good boy, Dave, a mighty good
boy. I don&#8217;t know what your ma would do
without you. I hed to leave school when I
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t as old as you, and git out and hustle so
the younger children could git eddicated. By
the time I wuz foot-loose from farm work, I wuz
too old to git any larnin&#8217;. You&#8217;d orter manage
someway, though, to git eddicated.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s taught me to read and write and
spell. When I get old enough to work for good
wages I can go into town to the night school.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a short time M&#8217;ri had cooked a dinner that
would have tempted less hearty appetites than
those possessed by her brother and David.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t what might be called a delikit
feeder, Dave,&#8221; remarked Barnabas, as he replenished
the boy&#8217;s plate for the third time. &#8220;You&#8217;re
so lean I don&#8217;t see where you put it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>David might have responded that the vacuum
was due to the fact that his breakfast had consisted
of a piece of bread and his last night&#8217;s
supper of a dish of soup, but the Dunne pride
inclined to reservation on family and personal
matters. He speared another small potato and
paused, with fork suspended between mouth and
plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says she thinks I am hollow inside
like a stovepipe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I dunno. Stovepipes git filled sometimes,&#8221;
ruminated his host.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave room for the ice cream, David,&#8221; cautioned
M&#8217;ri, as she descended to the cellar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes brightened as he beheld the
golden pyramid. Another period of lingering
bliss, and then with a sigh of mingled content
and regret, David rose from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to hook up for you, Mr. Brumble?&#8221;
he asked, moved to show his gratitude for the
hospitality extended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Dave; wish you would. My back
is sorter lame to-day. Land o&#8217; livin&#8217;,&#8221; he commented
after David had gone to the barn, &#8220;but
that boy swallered them potaters like they wuz
so many pills!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Mrs. Dunne!&#8221; sighed M&#8217;ri. &#8220;I am
afraid it&#8217;s all she can do to keep a very small
pot boiling. I am glad she sent the sorghum, so
I could have an excuse for sending the eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hain&#8217;t poor so long as she hez a young
sprout like Dave a-growin&#8217; up. We used to call
Peter Dunne &#8216;Old Hickory,&#8217; but Dave, he&#8217;s
second-growth hickory. He&#8217;s the kind to bend
and not break. Jest you wait till he&#8217;s seasoned
onct.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she had packed a pail of ice cream for
David, gathered some flowers for Ziny, and made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
out a memorandum of supplies for Barnabas to
get in town, M&#8217;ri set out on her errand of mercy.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hooking up&#8221; accomplished, David, laden
with a tin pail in each hand and carrying in his
pocket a drawing of black tea for his mother to
sample, made his way through sheep-dotted
pastures to Beechum&#8217;s woods, and thence along
the bank of the River Rood. Presently he spied
a young man standing knee-deep in the stream
in the patient pose peculiar to fishermen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Catch anything?&#8221; called David eagerly.</p>
<p>The man turned and came to shore. He wore
rubber hip boots, dark trousers, a blue flannel
shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes, blue
and straight-gazing, rested reminiscently upon
the lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied calmly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to
catch anything. What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man meditated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be about twelve years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a good guesser. What have you got in
your pail?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you were a good guesser.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do, David. Let me think&ndash;&ndash;where did
you come from just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Brumble&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ice cream you&#8217;ve got in your pail,&#8221; he
said assuredly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what it is!&#8221; cried the boy in
astonishment, &#8220;and there&#8217;s eggs in the other
pail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at the ice cream.&#8221;</p>
<p>David lifted the cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like butter,&#8221; declared the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t taste like butter,&#8221; was the indignant
rejoinder. &#8220;Miss M&#8217;ri makes the best cream of
any one in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, my young friend, before you
did. It&#8217;s a long time since I had any, though.
Will you sell it to me, David? I will give you
half a dollar for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half a dollar! His mother had to work all
day to earn that amount. The ice cream was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
his&ndash;&ndash;not entirely. Miss M&#8217;ri had sent it to his
mother. Still&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T will melt anyway before I get home,&#8221; he
argued aloud and persuasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will,&#8221; asserted the would-be purchaser.</p>
<p>David surrendered the pail, and after much
protestation consented to receive the piece of
money which the young man pressed upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to help me eat it now; there&#8217;s no
pleasure in eating ice cream alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any spoons,&#8221; commented the boy
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go to my house and eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221; asked David in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just around the bend of the river here.&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s freckles darkened. He didn&#8217;t like to
be made game of by older people, for then there
was no redress.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any house within two miles of
here,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you bet? Half a dollar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied David resolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come and see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>David followed his new acquaintance around
the wooded bank. The river was full of surprises
to-day. In midstream he saw what looked
to him like a big raft supporting a small house.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my shanty boat,&#8221; explained the young
man, as he shoved a rowboat from shore. &#8220;Jump
in, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live in it all the time?&#8221; asked David,
watching with admiration the easy but forceful
pull on the oars.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I am on a little fishing and hunting expedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t kill anything now,&#8221; said the boy, a
derisive smile flickering over his features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not hunting to kill, my lad. I am hunting
old scenes and memories of other days. I
used to live about here. I ran away eight years
ago when I was just your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked David interestedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Forbes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; was the eager rejoinder. &#8220;I know.
You are Deacon Forbes&#8217; wild son that ran
away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how I am known around here, is
it? Well, I&#8217;ve come back, to settle up my
father&#8217;s estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you run away for?&#8221; inquired
David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combination of too much stepmother and a
roving spirit, I guess. Here we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang on the platform of the shanty boat
and helped David on board. The boy inspected
this novel house in wonder while his host set
saucers and spoons on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind,&#8221; asked David in an embarrassed
manner as he wistfully eyed the coveted
luxury, &#8220;if I took my dishful home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Forbes, his eyes
twinkling. &#8220;Eaten too much already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but you see my mother likes it and she
hasn&#8217;t had any since last summer. I&#8217;d rather
take mine to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty left for your mother. I&#8217;ll
put this pail in a bigger one and pack ice about
it. Then it won&#8217;t melt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you paid me for it,&#8221; protested David.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. Your mother was pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
good to me when I was a boy. She dried my
mop of hair for me once so my stepmother would
not know I&#8217;d been in swimming. Tell her I sent
the cream to her. Say, you were right about
Miss M&#8217;ri making the best cream in the country.
It used to be a chronic pastime with her. That&#8217;s
how I guessed what you had when you said you
came from there. Whenever there was a picnic
or a surprise party in the country she always
furnished the ice cream. Isn&#8217;t she married yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she keep company with some lucky
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; again denied the boy emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? She used to be awfully
pretty and sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is now, but she don&#8217;t want any man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, David, that isn&#8217;t quite natural,
you know. Why do you think she doesn&#8217;t want
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard say she was crossed once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crossed, David? And what might that be?&#8221;
asked Forbes in a delighted feint of perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disappointed in love, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it all comes back now&ndash;&ndash;the gossip of
my boyhood days. She was going with a man
when Barnabas&#8217; wife died and left two children&ndash;&ndash;one
a baby&ndash;&ndash;and Miss M&#8217;ri gave up her lover
to do her duty by her brother&#8217;s family. So
Barnabas never married again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Miss M&#8217;ri keeps house and brings up
Jud and Janey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember Jud&ndash;&ndash;mean little shaver. Janey
must be the baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s eight now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you, David. You were a little
toddler of four&ndash;&ndash;all eyes. Your folks had a
place right on the edge of town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We left it when I was six years old and came
out here,&#8221; informed David.</p>
<p>Forbes&#8217; groping memory recalled the gossip
that had reached him in the Far West. &#8220;Dunne
went to prison,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;and the farm was
mortgaged to defray the expenses of the trial.&#8221;
He hastened back to a safer channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss M&#8217;ri was foolish to spoil her life and
the man&#8217;s for fancied duty,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>David bridled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Barnabas couldn&#8217;t go to school when he was
a boy because he had to work so she and the other
children could go. She&#8217;d ought to have stood
by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you have a sense of duty, too. This
county was always strong on duty. I suppose
they&#8217;ve got it in for me because I ran away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brumble says it was a wise thing for you
to do. Uncle Larimy says you were a brick of
a boy. Miss Rhody says she had no worry about
her woodpile getting low when you were here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Miss Rhody! Does she still live alone?
And Uncle Larimy&ndash;&ndash;is he uncle to the whole
community? What fishing days I had with
him! I must look him up and tell him all my
adventures. I have planned a round of calls
for to-night&ndash;&ndash;Miss M&#8217;ri, Miss Rhody, Uncle
Larimy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about your adventures,&#8221; demanded
David breathlessly.</p>
<p>He listened to a wondrous tale of western life,
and never did narrator get into so close relation
with his auditor as did this young ranchman with
David Dunne.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I must go home,&#8221; said the boy reluctantly
when Joe had concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down to-morrow, David, and we&#8217;ll go
fishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>With heart as light as air, David sped through
the woods. He had found his Hero.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>David struck out from the shelter of the
woodland and made his way to his home,
a pathetically small, rudely constructed house.
The patch of land supposed to be a garden, and
in proportion to the dimensions of the building,
showed a few feeble efforts at vegetation. It
was not positively known that the Widow Dunne
had a clear title to her homestead, but one would
as soon think of foreclosing a mortgage on a
playhouse, or taking a nest from a bird, as to
press any claim on this fallow fragment in the
midst of prosperous farmlands.</p>
<p>Some discouraged looking fowls picked at the
scant grass, a lean cow switched a lackadaisical
tail, and in a pen a pig grunted his discontent.</p>
<p>David went into the little kitchen, where a
woman was bending wearily over a washtub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; cried the boy in dismay, &#8220;you said
you&#8217;d let the washing go till to-morrow. That&#8217;s
why I didn&#8217;t come right back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>She paused in the rubbing of a soaped garment
and wrung the suds from her tired and
swollen hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt better, David, and I thought I&#8217;d get
them ready for you to hang out.&#8221;</p>
<p>David took the garment from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down and eat this ice cream Miss M&#8217;ri
sent&ndash;&ndash;no, I mean Joe Forbes sent you. There
was more, but I sold it for half a dollar; and
here&#8217;s a pail of eggs and a drawing of tea she
wants you to sample. She says she is no judge
of black tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Forbes!&#8221; exclaimed his mother interestedly.
&#8220;I thought maybe he would be coming
back to look after the estate. Is he going to
stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all about him, mother, if you
will sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began a vigorous turning of the wringer.</p>
<p>The patient, tired-looking eyes of the woman
brightened as she dished out a saucer of the
cream. The weariness in the sensitive lines of her
face and the prominence of her knuckles bore
evidence of a life of sordid struggle, but, above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
all, the mother love illumined her features with a
flash of radiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good provider, David; but tell me
where you have been for so long, and where did
you see Joe?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her a faithful account of his dinner
at the Brumble farm and his subsequent meeting
with Joe, working the wringer steadily as he
talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction,
&#8220;they are ready for the line, but before I
hang them out I am going to cook your dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am rested now, David. I will cook me an
egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will,&#8221; insisted the boy, going to the
stove.</p>
<p>A few moments later, with infinite satisfaction,
he watched her partake of crisp toast, fresh
eggs, and savory tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Jud and Janey?&#8221; she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they were at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David, you shall go regularly to school next
fall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said David stoutly; &#8220;next fall I am going
to work regularly for some of the farmers,
and you are not going to wash any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes grew moist.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, will you always be good&ndash;&ndash;will you
grow up to be as good a man as I want you to
be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How good do you want me to be?&#8221; he asked
dubiously.</p>
<p>A radiant and tender smile played about her
mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not goodygood, David; but will you always
be honest, and brave, and kind, as you are now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And never forget those who do you a kindness,
David; always show your gratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, David, watch your temper and, whatever
happens, I shall have no fears for your
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mother seldom talked to him in this wise.
He thought about it after he lay in his little cot
in the sitting room that night; then his mind
wandered to Joe Forbes and his wonderful tales
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of the West. He fell asleep to dream of cowboys
and prairies. When he awoke the sun was
sending golden beams through the eastward
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother isn&#8217;t up,&#8221; he thought in surprise. He
stole quietly out to the kitchen, kindled a fire
with as little noise as possible, put the kettle
over, set the table, and then went into the one
tiny bedroom where his mother lay in her bed,
still&ndash;&ndash;very still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said softly.</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he repeated. Then piercingly, in
excitement and fear, &#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>At last he knew.</p>
<p>He ran wildly to the outer door. Bill Winters,
fortunately sober, was driving slowly by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Dave?&#8221; looking into the
boy&#8217;s white face. &#8220;Your ma ain&#8217;t sick, is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s lips quivered, but seemed almost unable
to articulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he finally whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send Zine right over,&#8221; exclaimed Bill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
slapping the reins briskly across the drooping
neck of his horse.</p>
<p>Very soon the little house was filled to overflowing
with kind and sympathetic neighbors
who had come to do all that had to be done.
David sat on the back doorstep until M&#8217;ri came;
before the expression in his eyes she felt powerless
to comfort him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor says your mother died in her
sleep,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t suffer any.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made no reply. Oppressed by the dull
pain for which there is no ease, he wandered from
the house to the garden, and from the garden
back to the house throughout the day. At sunset
Barnabas drove over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay here to-night, Barnabas,&#8221; said
M&#8217;ri, &#8220;but I want you to drive back and get some
things. I&#8217;ve made out a list. Janey will know
where to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t I take Dave back to stay to-night?&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri hesitated, and looked at David.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said dully, following Barnabas listlessly
down the path to the road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Barnabas, keen, shrewd, and sharp at a bargain,
had a heart that ever softened to motherless
children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;your ma won&#8217;t never
hev to wash no more, and she&#8217;ll never be sick nor
tired agen.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first leaven to his loss, and he held
tight to the horny hand of his comforter. After
Barnabas had driven away there came trudging
down the road the little, lithe figure of an old
man, who was carrying a large box. His mildly
blue, inquiring eyes looked out from beneath
their hedge of shaggy eyebrows. His hair and
his beard were thick and bushy. Joe Forbes
maintained that Uncle Larimy would look
no different if his head were turned upside
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve brung yer ma
some posies. She liked my yaller roses, you
know. I&#8217;m sorry my laylocks are gone. They
come early this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Uncle Larimy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A choking sensation warned David to say no
more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Things go &#8217;skew sometimes, Dave, but the sun
will shine agen,&#8221; reminded the old man, as he
went on into the house.</p>
<p>Later, when sundown shadows had vanished
and the first glimmer of the stars radiated from
a pale sky, Joe came over. David felt no thrill
at sight of his hero. The halo was gone. He
only remembered with a dull ache that the half
dollar had brought his mother none of the luxuries
he had planned to buy for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; said the young ranchman, his deep
voice softened, &#8220;my mother died when I was
younger than you are, but you won&#8217;t have a stepmother
to make life unbearable for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked at him with inscrutable eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go back with me to the
ranch, David? You can learn to ride and shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>David shook his head forlornly. His spirit of
adventure was smothered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it again, David,&#8221; he said,
as he went in to consult M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the only thing for the boy
to do is to go back with me? I am going to buy
the ranch on which I&#8217;ve been foreman, and I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
try to do for David all that should have been
done for me when I, at his age, felt homeless and
alone. He&#8217;s the kind that takes things hard and
quiet; life in the open will pull him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Joe,&#8221; replied M&#8217;ri resolutely. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
ready for that kind of life yet. He needs to
be with women and children a while longer.
Barnabas and I are going to take him. Barnabas
suggested it, and I told Mrs. Dunne one day,
when her burdens were getting heavy, that we
would do so if anything like this should happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe looked at her with revering eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss M&#8217;ri, you are so good to other people&#8217;s
children, what would you be to your own!&#8221;</p>
<p>The passing of M&#8217;ri&#8217;s youth had left a faint
flush of prettiness like the afterglow of a sunset
faded into twilight. She was of the kind that
old age would never wither. In the deep blue
eyes was a patient, reflective look that told of a
past but unforgotten romance. She turned from
his gaze, but not before he had seen the wistfulness
his speech had evoked. After he had gone,
she sought David.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to stay here with you, David, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
two or three days. Then Barnabas and I want
you to come to live with us. I had a long talk
with your mother one day, and I told her if anything
happened to her you should be our boy.
That made her less anxious about the future,
David. Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked up with his first gleam of interest
in mundane things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it, but would&ndash;&ndash;Jud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid Jud doesn&#8217;t like anything,
David,&#8221; she replied with a sigh. &#8220;That&#8217;s one
reason I want you&ndash;&ndash;to be a big brother to Janey,
for I think that is what she needs, and what Jud
can never be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy remembered what his mother had
counseled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll always take care of Janey,&#8221; he earnestly
assured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you will, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two dreary days passed in the way that such
days do pass, and then David rode to his new
home with Barnabas and M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>Jud Brumble, a refractory, ungovernable lad
of fifteen, didn&#8217;t look altogether unfavorably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
upon the addition to the household, knowing that
his amount of work would thereby be lessened,
and that he would have a new victim for his persecutions
and tyrannies.</p>
<p>Janey, a little rosebud of a girl with dimples
and flaxen curls, hung back shyly and looked at
David with awed eyes. She had been frightened
by what she had heard about his mother, and in a
vague, disconnected way she associated him with
Death. M&#8217;ri went to the child&#8217;s bedside that
night and explained the situation. &#8220;Poor Davey
is all alone, now, and very unhappy, so we must
be kind to him. I told him you were to be his
little sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then M&#8217;ri took David to a gabled room, at
each end of which was a swinging window&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;one
for seeing the sun rise, and one for seeing it set,&#8221;
she said, as she turned back the covers from the
spotless white bed. She yearned to console him,
but before the mute look of grief in his big eyes
she was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would cry,&#8221; she said wistfully to
Barnabas, &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t shed a tear since his mother
died.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>No sooner had the sound of her footsteps
ceased than David threw off his armor of self-restraint
and burst into a passion of sobs, the
wilder for their long repression. He didn&#8217;t hear
the patter of little feet on the floor, and not until
two mothering arms were about his neck did he
see the white-robed figure of Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Davey,&#8221; she implored, her quivering
red mouth against his cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry;
but I am your little sister now, so you must love
me, Davey. Aunt M&#8217;ri told me so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>The lilac-scented breeze of early morning
blowing softly through the vine-latticed
window and stirring its white draperies brought
David to wakefulness. With the first surprise
at the strangeness of his surroundings came a
fluttering of memory. The fragrance of lilacs
was always hereafter to bring back the awfulness
of this waking moment.</p>
<p>He hurriedly dressed, and went down to the
kitchen where M&#8217;ri was preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, David. Janey has gone to
find some fresh eggs. You may help her hunt
them, if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing the haunts of hens, he went toward
the currant bushes. It was one of those soft
days that link late spring and dawning summer.
The coolness of the sweet-odored air, the twitter
of numberless dawn birds, the entreating lowing
of distant cattle&ndash;&ndash;all breathing life and strength&ndash;&ndash;were
like a resurrection call to David.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>On the east porch, which was his retreat for a
smoke or a rest between the intervals of choring
and meals, Barnabas sat, securely wedged in by
the washing machine, the refrigerator, the plant
stand, the churn, the kerosene can, and the lawn
mower. He gazed reflectively after David.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to hev Dave do to help,
M&#8217;ri?&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri came to the door and considered a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, Barnabas, I am going to have
him eat. He is so thin and hungry looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas chuckled. His sister&#8217;s happiest mission
was the feeding of hungry children.</p>
<p>After breakfast, when Janey&#8217;s rebellious
curls were again being brushed into shape, M&#8217;ri
told David he could go to school if he liked. To
her surprise the boy flushed and looked uncomfortable.
M&#8217;ri&#8217;s intuitions were quick and generally
correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so near the end of the term, though,&#8221;
she added casually, as an afterthought, &#8220;that
maybe you had better wait until next fall to
start in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, please, Miss M&#8217;ri, I&#8217;d rather,&#8221; he said
quickly and gratefully.</p>
<p>When Janey, dinner pail in hand and books
under arm, was ready to start, David asked in
surprise where Jud was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he has gone long ago. He thinks he is
too big to walk with Janey.&#8221;</p>
<p>David quietly took the pail and books from
the little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to school, Janey, and come for
you this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t need to git no watch dog to foller
Janey,&#8221; said Barnabas, as the children started
down the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; called M&#8217;ri, &#8220;stop at Miss Rhody&#8217;s
on your way back and find out whether my waist
is finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>With proudly protective air, David walked
beside the stiffly starched little girl, who had
placed her hand trustfully in his. They had
gone but a short distance when they were overtaken
by Joe Forbes, mounted on a shining black
horse. He reined up and looked down on them
good-humoredly.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Going to school, children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. Davey&#8217;s just going to carry my
things for me,&#8221; explained Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can do that and carry you into the
bargain. Help her up, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janey cried out in delight at the prospect of a
ride. David lifted her up, and Joe settled her
comfortably in the saddle, encircling her with
his arm. Then he looked down whimsically into
David&#8217;s disappointed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s a mean trick, Dave, to take your
little sweetheart from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not my sweetheart; she&#8217;s my sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she promised to be that already? Get
up, Firefly.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were off over the smooth country road,
Forbes shouting a bantering good-by and Janey
waving a triumphant dinner pail, while David,
trudging on his way, experienced the desolate
feeling of the one who is left behind. Across
fields he came to the tiny, thatched cottage of
Miss Rhody Crabbe, who stood on the crumbling
doorstep feeding some little turkeys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, David. I suppose you&#8217;re after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
M&#8217;ri&#8217;s waist. Thar&#8217;s jest a few stitches to take,
and I&#8217;ll hev it done in no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her into the little house, which
consisted of a sitting room &#8220;with bedroom off,&#8221;
and a kitchen whose floor was sand scoured; the
few pieces of tinware could be used as mirrors.
Miss Rhody seated herself by the open window
and began to ply her needle. She did not sew
swiftly and smoothly, in feminine fashion, but
drew her long-threaded needle through the fabric
in abrupt and forceful jerks. A light breeze
fluttered in through the window, but it could not
ruffle the wisp-locked hair that showed traces of
a water-dipped comb and was strained back so
taut that a little mound of flesh encircled each
root. Her eyes were bead bright and swift moving.
Everything about her, to the aggressively
prominent knuckles, betokened energy and industry.
She was attired in a blue calico shortened
by many washings, but scrupulously clean
and conscientiously starched. Her face shone
with soap and serenity.</p>
<p>Miss Rhody&#8217;s one diversion in a busy but
monotonous life was news. She was wretched if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
she did not receive the latest bulletins; but it
was to her credit that she never repeated anything
that might work harm or mischief. David
was one of her chosen confidants. He was a
safe repository of secrets, a sympathetic listener,
and a wise suggester.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad M&#8217;ri&#8217;s hevin&#8217; a blue waist. She
looks so sweet in blue. I&#8217;ve made her clo&#8217;es fer
years. My, how I hoped fer to make her weddin&#8217;
clo&#8217;es onct! It wuz a shame to hev sech a
good match spiled. It wuz too bad she hed to
hev them two chillern on her hands&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now she has a third,&#8221; was what David
thought he read in her eyes, and he hastened to
assert: &#8220;I am going to help all I can, and I&#8217;ll
soon be old enough to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes, David, you&#8217;d be wuth more&#8217;n
yer keep to any one. I wonder,&#8221; she said ruminatingly,
&#8220;if Martin Thorne will wait for her
till Janey&#8217;s growed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Thorne!&#8221; exclaimed David excitedly.
&#8220;Judge Thorne? Why, was he the one&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He spent his Sunday evenings with her,&#8221; she
asserted solemnly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>In the country code of courtships this procedure
was conclusive proof, and David accepted
it as such.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wuz jest plain Lawyer Thorne when he
wuz keepin&#8217; company with M&#8217;ri, but we all knew
Mart wuz a comin&#8217; man, and M&#8217;ri wuz jest proud
of him. You could see that, and he wuz sot on
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her work momentarily neglected, Rhody was
making little reminiscent stabs at space with her
needle as she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T wuz seven years ago. M&#8217;ri wuz twenty-eight
and Mart ten years older. It would hev
ben a match as sure as preachin&#8217;, but Eliza died
and M&#8217;ri, she done her duty as she seen it. Sometimes
I think folks is near-sighted about their
duty. There is others as is queer-sighted. Bein&#8217;
crossed hain&#8217;t spiled M&#8217;ri though. She&#8217;s kep&#8217;
sweet through it all, but when a man don&#8217;t git
his own way, he&#8217;s apt to curdle. Mart got sort
of tart-tongued and cold feelin&#8217;. There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
no reason why they couldn&#8217;t a kep&#8217; on bein&#8217;
friends, but Mart must go and make a fool vow
that he&#8217;d never speak to M&#8217;ri until she sent him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
word she&#8217;d changed her mind, so he hez ben
a-spitin&#8217; of his face ever sence. It&#8217;s wonderful
how some folks do git in their own way, but, my
sakes, I must git to work so you kin take this
waist home.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was David&#8217;s first glimpse of a romance
outside of story-books, but the name of Martin
Thorne evoked disturbing memories. Six years
ago he had acted as attorney to David&#8217;s father
in settling his financial difficulties, and later,
after Peter Dunne&#8217;s death, the Judge had settled
the small estate. It was only through his efforts
that they were enabled to have the smallest of
roofs over their defenseless heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rhody,&#8221; he asked after a long meditation
on life in general, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you ever
marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rhody paused again in her work, and
two little spots of red crept into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t from ch&#8217;ice I&#8217;ve lived single, David.
I&#8217;ve ben able to take keer of myself, but I allers
hed a hankerin&#8217; same as any woman, as is a woman,
hez fer a man, but I never got no chanst to
meet men folks. I wuz raised here, and folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
allers hed it all cut out fer me to be an old maid.
When a woman onct gets that name fixt on her,
it&#8217;s all off with her chances. No man ever comes
nigh her, and she can&#8217;t git out of her single rut.
I never could get to go nowhars, and I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
that bold kind that makes up to a man fust, afore
he gives a sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>David pondered over this wistful revelation
for a few moments, seeking a means for her
seemingly hopeless escape from a life of single
blessedness, for David was a sympathetic young
altruist, and felt it incumbent upon him to lift
the burdens of his neighbors. Then he suggested
encouragingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rhody, did you know that there was a
paper that gets you acquainted with men?
That&#8217;s the way they say Zine Winters got
married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and look what she drawed!&#8221; she scoffed.
&#8220;Bill! I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;d live if Zine
hadn&#8217;t a-gone in heavy on hens and turkeys.
She hez to spend her hull time a-traipsin&#8217; after
them turkeys, and thar ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; that&#8217;s given
to gaddin&#8217; like turkeys that I know on, less &#8217;t is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Chubbses&#8217; hired gal. No, David, it&#8217;s chance
enough when you git a man you&#8217;ve knowed
allers, but a stranger! Well! I want to know
what I&#8217;m gittin&#8217;. Thar, the last stitch in M&#8217;ri&#8217;s
waist is took, and, David, you won&#8217;t tell no one
what I said about Mart Thorne and her, nor
about my gittin&#8217; merried?&#8221;</p>
<p>David gave her a reproachful look, and she
laughed shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, David, you kin keep a secret. It&#8217;s
like buryin&#8217; a thing to tell it to you. My, this
waist&#8217;ll look fine on M&#8217;ri. I jest love the feel
of silk. I&#8217;d ruther hev a black silk dress than&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A husband,&#8221; prompted David slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne, I&#8217;ll box yer ears if you ever
think again of what I said. I am allers a-thinkin&#8217;
of you as if you wuz a stiddy grown man,
and then fust thing I know you&#8217;re nuthin&#8217; but
a teasin&#8217; boy. Here&#8217;s the bundle, and don&#8217;t you
want a nutcake, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Miss Rhody. I ate a big
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow feeling had prompted David even in
his hungriest days to refrain from accepting Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Rhody&#8217;s proffers of hospitality. He knew the
emptiness of her larder, for though she had been
thrifty and hard-working, she had paid off a
mortgage and had made good the liabilities of
an erring nephew.</p>
<p>When David returned he found Miss M&#8217;ri in
the dairy. It was churning day, and she was
arranging honey-scented, rose-stamped pats of
butter on moist leaves of crisp lettuce.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she asked, looking up with a winning
smile, &#8220;will you tell me why you didn&#8217;t
want to go to school?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s face reddened, but his eyes looked
frankly into hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss M&#8217;ri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you tell me, David,&#8221; she interposed,
&#8220;I want you to remember that, from now on,
Barnabas and I are your uncle and aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Aunt M&#8217;ri,&#8221; began David, a ring
of tremulous eagerness in his voice, &#8220;I can read
and write and spell, but I don&#8217;t know much
about arithmetic and geography. I was ashamed
to start in at the baby class. I thought I&#8217;d
try and study out of Jud&#8217;s books this summer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea, David. We&#8217;ll begin
now. You&#8217;ll find an elementary geography in
the sitting room on the shelf, and you may
study the first lesson. This afternoon, when my
work is done, I&#8217;ll hear you recite it.&#8221;</p>
<p>David took the book and went out into the old
orchard. When M&#8217;ri went to call him to dinner
he was sprawled out in the latticed shadow of
an apple tree, completely absorbed in the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have spent two hours on your first
lesson, David. You ought to have it well
learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read the whole book through, Aunt M&#8217;ri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, David,&#8221; she expostulated, &#8220;that&#8217;s the
way Barnabas takes his medicine. Instead of
the prescribed dose after each meal he takes
three doses right after breakfast&ndash;&ndash;so as to get
it off his mind and into his system, he says.
We&#8217;ll just have one short lesson in geography
and one in arithmetic each day. You mustn&#8217;t
do things in leaps. It&#8217;s the steady dog trot
that lasts, and counts on the long journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>When David was on his way to bring Janey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
from school that afternoon he was again overtaken
by Joe Forbes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, I am going to Chicago in a few days,
and I shall stop there long enough to buy a few
presents to send back to some of my friends.
Here&#8217;s my list. Let me see, Uncle Larimy, a
new-fangled fishing outfit; Barnabas, a pipe;
Miss M&#8217;ri&ndash;&ndash;guess, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the guesser, you know,&#8221; reminded
David.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new kind of ice-cream freezer, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to freeze ice to-night,&#8221; recalled
David anticipatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freeze ice! What a paradoxical process!
But what I want you to suggest is something for
Miss Rhody&ndash;&ndash;something very nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What she wants most is something you can&#8217;t
get her,&#8221; thought David, looking up with a tantalizing
little smile. Then her second wish occurred
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know something she wants dreadfully;
something she never expects to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what I want to get for her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll cost a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe disposed of that consideration by a munificent
wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A black silk dress,&#8221; informed the boy delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall have it. How many yards does it
take, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can ask Janey&#8217;s teacher when we get to
school,&#8221; suggested the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we can. I contrived to find out that
Janey&#8217;s heart is set on a string of beads&ndash;&ndash;blue
beads. I suppose, to be decent, I shall have to
include Jud. What will it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants a gun. He&#8217;s a good shot, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>They loitered on the way, discussing Joe&#8217;s
gifts, until they met Janey and Little Teacher
coming toward them hand in hand. David
quickly secured the pail and books before Joe
could appropriate them. He wasn&#8217;t going to
be cut out a second time in one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Williams,&#8221; asked the young ranchman,
&#8220;will your knowledge of mathematics tell me how
many yards of black silk I must get to make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
dress, and what kind of fixings I shall need for
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to know,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Just
go into any department store and tell them you
want a dress pattern and the findings. They
will do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shopping made easy. You shall have your
reward now. My shanty boat is just about opposite
here. Suppose the four of us go down
to the river and have supper on board?&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Teacher, to whom life was a vista of
blackboards dotted with vacations, thought this
would be delightful. A passing child was made
a messenger to the farm, and they continued
their way woodward to the river, where the
shanty boat was anchored. Little Teacher set the
table, Joe prepared the meal, while David sat
out on deck, beguiling Janey with wonderful
stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems beautifully domestic to a cowboy,&#8221;
sighed Joe, looking around the supper table, his
gaze lingering on Little Teacher, who was dimpling
happily. Imaginative David proceeded to
weave his third romance that day, with a glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
little beating of the heart, for he had feared that
Joe might be planning to wait for Janey, as the
Judge was doubtless waiting for M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>The children went directly home after supper,
Joe accompanying Little Teacher. Despite the
keenness of David&#8217;s sorrow the day had been a
peaceful, contented one, but when the shadows
began to lengthen to that most lonesome hour of
lonesome days, when from home-coming cows
comes the sound of tinkling bells, a wave of longing
swept over him, and he stole away to the orchard.
Again, a soft, sustaining little hand crept
into his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Davey,&#8221; pleaded a caressing voice,
&#8220;don&#8217;t make me cry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>Outside of the time allotted for the performance
of a wholesome amount of farm
work and the preparation of his daily lessons,
David was free for diversions which had hitherto
entered sparingly into his life. After school hours
and on Saturdays the Barnabas farm was the
general rendezvous for all the children within a
three-mile radius. The old woods by the river
rang with the gay treble of childish laughter and
the ecstatic barking of dogs dashing in frantic
pursuit. There was always an open sesame to
the cookie jar and the apple barrel.</p>
<p>David suffered the common fate of all in having
a dark cloud. Jud was the dark cloud, and
his silver lining had not yet materialized.</p>
<p>In height and physical strength Jud was the
superior, so he delighted in taunting and goading
the younger boy. There finally came a day
when instinctive self-respect upheld David in
no longer resisting the call to arms. Knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Barnabas&#8217; disapproval of fighting, and with his
mother&#8217;s parting admonition pricking his conscience,
he went into battle reluctantly and half-heartedly,
so the fight was not prolonged, and
Jud&#8217;s victory came easily. Barnabas, hurrying
to the scene of action, called Jud off and reprimanded
him for fighting a smaller boy, which
hurt David far more than did the pummeling he
had received.</p>
<p>&#8220;What wuz you fighting fer, anyway?&#8221; he demanded
of David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied David laconically, &#8220;just
fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud picks on Davey all the time,&#8221; was the information
furnished by the indignant Janey, who
had followed her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I forbid either one of you to fight again.
Now, Jud, see that you leave Dave alone after
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emboldened by his easily won conquest and
David&#8217;s apparent lack of prowess, Jud continued
his jeering and nagging, but David set his lips
in a taut line of finality and endured in silence
until there came the taunt superlative.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother was a washerwoman, and your
father a convict.&#8221;</p>
<p>There surged through David a fierce animal
hate. With a tight closing of his hardy young
fist, he rushed to the onslaught so swiftly and so
impetuously that Jud recoiled in fear and surprise.
With his first tiger-like leap David had
the older boy by the throat and bore him to the
ground, maintaining and tightening his grip as
they went down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s voice was steady and calm, but the
boy on the ground underneath felt the very hairs
of his head rising at the look in the dark eyes
above his own.</p>
<p>Fortunately for both of them Barnabas was
again at hand.</p>
<p>He jerked David to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fightin&#8217; again, are you, after I told you not
to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was him, David, that began it. I never
struck him,&#8221; whimpered Jud, edging away behind
his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, David?&#8221; asked Barnabas bluntly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
still keeping his hold on the boy, who was quivering
with passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice sounded odd and tired, and there
was an ache of bafflement in his young eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What fer? What did he do to make you so
mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said my mother was a washerwoman
and my father a convict! Let me go! I&#8217;ll kill
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a returning rush of his passion, David
struggled in the man&#8217;s grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Dave, I&#8217;ll tend to him. Go to the
barn, Jud!&#8221; he commanded his son.</p>
<p>Jud quailed before this new, strange note in
his father&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;David was fighting. You said neither of us
was to fight. &#8217;T ain&#8217;t fair to take it out on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairness was one of Barnabas&#8217; fixed and prominent
qualities, but Jud was not to gain favor
by it this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to lick
Dave fer defendin&#8217; his parents, do you? Besides,
I&#8217;m not a-goin&#8217; to lick you fer fightin&#8217;, but fer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
sayin&#8217; what you did. I guess you&#8217;d hev found
out that Dave could wallop you ef he is smaller
and younger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t!&#8221; snarled Jud. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have no
show. He came at me by surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas reflected a moment. Then he said
gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;When it&#8217;s in the blood of two fellers to fight,
why thar&#8217;s got to be a fight, that&#8217;s all. Thar
won&#8217;t never be no peace until this ere question&#8217;s
settled. Dave, do you still want to fight him?&#8221;</p>
<p>A fierce aftermath of passion gleamed in
David&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; he cried, his nostrils quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll fight fair? Jest to punish&ndash;&ndash;with
no thought of killin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight fair,&#8221; agreed the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that you do. Come here, Jud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to fight,&#8221; protested Jud sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s afraid,&#8221; said David gleefully, every
muscle quivering and straining.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t!&#8221; yelled Jud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then,&#8221; challenged David, a fierce
joy tugging at his heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>Jud came with deliberate precision and a swing
of his left. He was heavier and harder, but
David was more agile, and his whole heart
was in the fight this time. They clutched and
grappled and parried, and finally went down;
first one was on top, then the other. It was the
wage of brute force against elasticity; bluster
against valor. Jud fought in fear; David, in
ferocity. At last David bore his oppressor backward
and downward. Jud, exhausted, ceased to
struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar!&#8221; exclaimed Barnabas, drawing a relieved
breath. &#8220;I guess you know how you stand
now, and we&#8217;ll all feel better. You&#8217;ve got all
that&#8217;s comin&#8217; to you, Jud, without no more from
me. You can both go to the house and wash
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Larimy had arrived at the finish of the
fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Barnabas?&#8221; he asked interestedly,
as the boys walked away.</p>
<p>The explanation was given, but they spoke in
tones so low that David could not overhear any
part of the conversation from the men following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
him until, as they neared the house, Uncle Larimy
said: &#8220;I was afeerd Dave hed his pa&#8217;s temper
snoozin&#8217; inside him. Mebby he&#8217;d orter be told
fer a warnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say nuthin&#8217; about it less I hev
to. I&#8217;ll wait till the next time he loses his
temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>David ducked his head in the wash basin on
the bench outside the door. After supper, when
Barnabas came out on the back porch for his
hour of pipe, he called his young charge to him.
Since the fight, David&#8217;s face had worn a subdued
but contented expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks,&#8221; thought Barnabas, &#8220;kinder eased off,
like a dog when he licks his chops arter the taste
of blood has been drawed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Set down, Dave. I want to talk to you. You
done right to fight fer yer folks, and you&#8217;re a
good fighter, which every boy orter be, but when
I come up to you and Jud I see that in yer face
that I didn&#8217;t know was in you. You&#8217;ve got an
orful temper, Dave. It&#8217;s a good thing to hev&ndash;&ndash;a
mighty good thing, if you kin take keer of it,
but if you let it go it&#8217;s what leads to murder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Your pa hed the same kind of let-loose temper
that got him into heaps of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did my father do?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>Instinctively he had shrunk from asking his
mother this question, and pride had forbidden his
seeking the knowledge elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day, when you are older, you will know
all about it. But remember, when any one says
anything like what Jud did, that yer ma wouldn&#8217;t
want fer you to hev thoughts of killin&#8217;. You
see, you fought jest as well&ndash;&ndash;probably better&ndash;&ndash;when
you hed cooled off a mite and hed promised
to fight fair. And ef you can&#8217;t wrastle your
temper and down it as you did Jud, you&#8217;re not
a fust-class fighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said David slowly, unable, however,
to feel much remorse for his outbreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud&#8217;ll let you alone arter this. You&#8217;d better
go to bed now. You need a little extry sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri came into his room when he was trying to
mend a long rent in his shirt. He flushed uncomfortably
when her eye fell on the garment.
She took it from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll mend it, David. I don&#8217;t wonder that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
your patience slipped its leash, but&ndash;&ndash;never fight
when you have murder in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she had left the room, Janey&#8217;s face, pink
and fair as a baby rose, looked in at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very wicked to fight and get so mad,
Davey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he acknowledged readily. It was
useless trying to make a girl understand.</p>
<p>There was a silence. Janey still lingered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Davey,&#8221; she asked in an awed whisper, &#8220;does
it feel nice to be wicked?&#8221;</p>
<p>David shook his head non-committally.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>The rather strained relations between Jud
and David were eased the next day by the
excitement attending the big package Barnabas
brought from town. It was addressed to
David, but the removal of the outer wrapping
disclosed a number of parcels neatly labeled,
also a note from Joe, asking him to distribute
the presents.</p>
<p>David first selected the parcel marked
&#8220;Janey&#8221; and handed it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue beads!&#8221; she cried ecstatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see, Janey,&#8221; said M&#8217;ri. &#8220;Why,
they&#8217;re real turquoises and with a gold clasp!
I&#8217;ll get you a string of blue beads for now,
and you can put these away till you&#8217;re grown
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell Joe what to get for you, Aunt
M&#8217;ri; honest, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; disclaimed David, with
a laugh, as he handed the freezer to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll initiate it this very day, David.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>David handed Barnabas his pipe and gave
Jud a letter which he opened wonderingly,
uttering a cry of pleasure when he realized
the contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an order on Harkness to let me pick
out any rifle in his store. How did he know?
Did you tell him, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Dave. I&#8217;ll ride right down and
get it, and we&#8217;ll go to the woods this afternoon
and shoot at a mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed David heartily.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was now quite cleared by
the proposed expenditure of ammunition, and
M&#8217;ri experienced the sensation as of one beholding
a rainbow.</p>
<p>David then turned his undivided attention to
his own big package, which contained twelve
books, his name on the fly-leaf of each. Robinson
Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, Andersen&#8217;s
Fairy Tales, Arabian Nights, Life of Lincoln,
Black Beauty, Oliver Twist, A Thousand
Leagues under the Sea, The Pathfinder, Gulliver&#8217;s
Travels, Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin, and Young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Ranchers comprised the selection. His eyes
gleamed over the enticing titles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have some book shelves for your
room, David,&#8221; promised M&#8217;ri, &#8220;and you can
start your library. Joe has made a good foundation
for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes longed to read at once, but there
were still the two packages, marked &#8220;Uncle
Larimy&#8221; and &#8220;Miss Rhody,&#8221; to deliver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that Uncle Larimy has a fishing
rod, but what do you suppose he has sent
Rhody?&#8221; wondered M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black silk dress. I told him she wanted
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it right over there, David. She has
waited almost a lifetime for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take Uncle Larimy&#8217;s present,&#8221; suggested
Jud, &#8220;and then I&#8217;ll ask him to go shooting
with us this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>David amicably agreed, and went across fields
to Miss Rhody&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; she exclaimed, looking at the
parcel. &#8220;M&#8217;ri ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to hev another dress
so soon, is she?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Rhody. Some one else is,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, David?&#8221; she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see Joe Forbes sent some presents from
Chicago, and this is what he sent you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A calico,&#8221; was her divination, as she opened
the package.</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne!&#8221; she cried in shrill, piping
tones, a spot of red on each cheek. &#8220;Just look
here!&#8221; and she stroked lovingly the lustrous fold
of shining silk.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if here ain&#8217;t linings, and thread, and
sewing silk, and hooks and eyes! Why, David
Dunne, it can&#8217;t be true! How did he know&ndash;&ndash;David,
you blessed boy, you must have told
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Impulsively she threw her arms about him
and hugged him until he ruefully admitted to
himself that she had Jud &#8220;beat on the clutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And say, David, I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to wear this
dress. I know folks as lets their silks wear out
a-hangin&#8217; up in closets. Don&#8217;t get half as many
cracks when it hangs on yourself. I b&#8217;lieve as
them Episcopals do in lettin&#8217; yer light shine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
and I never wuz one of them as b&#8217;lieved in
savin&#8217; yer best to be laid out in. Oh, Lord,
David, I kin jest hear myself a-rustlin&#8217; round
in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll get a husband now,&#8221; suggested
David gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby. I&#8217;d orter ketch somethin&#8217; with this.
I never see sech silk. It&#8217;s much handsomer than
the one Homer Bisbee&#8217;s bride hed when she
come here from the city. It&#8217;s orful the way
she wastes. Would you b&#8217;lieve it, David, the
fust batch of pies she made, she never pricked,
and they all puffed up and bust. David, look
here! What&#8217;s in this envylope? Forever and
way back, ef it hain&#8217;t a five-doller bill and a
letter. I hain&#8217;t got my glasses handy. Read
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Miss Rhody,&#8221; read the boy in his
musical voice, &#8220;silk is none too good for you, and
I want you to wear this and wear it out. If
you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll never send you another. I
thought you might want some more trimmings,
so I send you a five for same. Sincerely yours,
Joe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need no trimmin&#8217;s, excep&#8217; fifty cents
for roochin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what to do, Miss Rhody. When
you get your dress made we&#8217;ll go into town and
you can get your picture taken in the dress and
give it to Joe when he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest what I&#8217;ll do. I never hed my
likeness took. David, you&#8217;ve got an orful quick
mind. Is Joe coming home? I thought he callated
to go West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until fall. He&#8217;s going to spend the
summer in his shanty boat on the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hurry up and get it made up afore he
comes. Tell me what he sent all your folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe&#8217;s a generous boy, like his ma&#8217;s folks,&#8221;
she continued, when he had enumerated their
gifts. &#8220;I am glad fer him that his pa and his
stepmother was so scrimpin&#8217;. David, would you
b&#8217;lieve it, in that great big house of the Forbeses
thar wa&#8217;n&#8217;t never a tidy on a chair, and not a
picter on the wall! It was mighty lucky for
Joe that his stepmother died fust, so he got all
the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>David hastened home and sought his retreat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
in the orchard with one of his books. M&#8217;ri,
curious to know what his selection had been,
scanned the titles of the remaining eleven
volumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who would have thought of a boy&#8217;s
preferring fairy tales!&#8221;</p>
<p>David read until dinner time, but spent the
afternoon with Uncle Larimy and Jud in the
woods, where they received good instruction in
rifle practice. After supper he settled comfortably
down with a book, from which he was
recalled by a plaintive little wail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a bit of fun to-day, Davey,
and it&#8217;s Saturday, and you haven&#8217;t played with
me at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>The book closed instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out doors, Janey,&#8221; he invited.</p>
<p>The sound of childish laughter fell pleasantly
on M&#8217;ri&#8217;s ears. She recalled what Joe Forbes
had said about her own children, and an unbidden
tear lingered on her lashes. This little
space between twilight and lamplight was M&#8217;ri&#8217;s
favorite hour. In every season but winter it
was spent on the west porch, where she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
watch the moon and the stars come out. Maybe,
too, it was because from here she had been
wont to sit in days gone by and watch for Martin&#8217;s
coming. The time and place were conducive
to backward flights of memory, and
M&#8217;ri&#8217;s pictures of the past were most beguiling,
except that last one when Martin Thorne, stern-faced,
unrelenting, and vowing that he would
never see her again, had left her alone&ndash;&ndash;to do
her duty.</p>
<p>When the children came in she joined them.
Janey, flushed and breathless from play, was
curled up on the couch beside David. He put
his arm caressingly about her and began to
relate one of Andersen&#8217;s fairy tales. M&#8217;ri gazed
at them tenderly, and was weaving a future little
romance for her two young charges when
Janey said petulantly: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like fairy
stories, Davey. Tell a real one.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri noted the disappointment in the boy&#8217;s
eyes as he began the narrating of a more realistic
story.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, where did you read that story?&#8221; she
asked when he had finished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I made it up,&#8221; he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, David, I didn&#8217;t know you had such a
talent. You must be an author when you are
a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Late that night she saw a light shining from
beneath the young narrator&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to send him to bed,&#8221; she meditated,
&#8220;but, poor lad, he has had so few pleasures and,
after all, childhood is the only time for thorough
enjoyment, so why should I put a feather in its
path?&#8221;</p>
<p>David read until after midnight, and went to
bed with a book under his pillow that he might
begin his pastime again at dawn.</p>
<p>After breakfast the next morning M&#8217;ri commanded
the whole family to sit down and write
their thanks to Joe. David&#8217;s willing pen flew
in pace with his thoughts as he told of Miss
Rhody&#8217;s delight and his own revel in book
land. Janey made most wretched work of her
composition. She sighed and struggled with
thoughts and pencil, which she gnawed at both
ends. Finally she confessed that she couldn&#8217;t
think of anything more to say. M&#8217;ri came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
inspect her literary effort, which was written in
huge characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Joe&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; commented M&#8217;ri doubtfully, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know as you should address him so familiarly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I called him &#8216;Joe&#8217; when we rode to school.
He told me to,&#8221; defended Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just like a boy,&#8221; suggested David.</p>
<p>So M&#8217;ri, silenced, read on: &#8220;I thank you for
your beyewtifull present which I cannot have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Janey,&#8221; expostulated M&#8217;ri, laughing;
&#8220;that doesn&#8217;t sound very gracious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you said I couldn&#8217;t have them till I
was grown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; admitted M&#8217;ri. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
realize it then. We have to see a thing written
sometimes to know how it sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I wear them?&#8221; asked Janey exultingly.
&#8220;May I put them on now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; consented M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>Janey flew upstairs and came back wearing
the adored turquoises, which made her eyes most
beautifully blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I can write,&#8221; she affirmed, taking up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
her pencil with the impetus of an incentive.
Under the inspiration of the beads around her
neck, she wrote:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Joe:</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I am wareing the beyewtifull beeds you sent me around

with you agen. Good bye. From your frend,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Janey.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>The next day being town day, David
&#8220;hooked up&#8221; Old Hundred and drove to
the house. After the butter crock, egg pails,
and kerosene and gasoline cans had been piled
in, Barnabas squeezed into the space beside
David. M&#8217;ri came out with a memorandum of
supplies for them to get in town. To David
she handed a big bunch of spicy, pink June
roses.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do with them?&#8221; he asked wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them to some one who looks as if he
needed flowers,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; declared the boy interestedly. &#8220;I
will watch them all and see how they look at the
roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last M&#8217;ri had a kindred spirit in her household.
Jud would have sneered, and Janey
would not have understood. To Barnabas all
flowers looked alike.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>It had come to be a custom for Barnabas to
take David to town with him at least once a
week. The trip was necessarily a slow one, for
from almost every farmhouse he received a petition
to &#8220;do a little errand in town.&#8221; As the
good nature and accommodating tendency of
Barnabas were well known, they were accordingly
imposed upon. He received commissions
of every character, from the purchase of a corn
sheller to the matching of a blue ribbon. He
also stopped to pick up a child or two en route
to school or to give a lift to a weary pedestrian
whom he overtook.</p>
<p>While Barnabas made his usual rounds of
the groceries, meatmarket, drug store, mill,
feed store, general store, and a hotel where he
was well known, David was free to go where
he liked. Usually he accompanied Barnabas,
but to-day he walked slowly up the principal
business street, watching for &#8220;one who needed
flowers.&#8221; Many glances were bestowed upon
the roses, some admiring, some careless, and then&ndash;&ndash;his
heart almost stopped beating at the significance&ndash;&ndash;Judge
Thorne came by. He, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
glanced at the roses. His gaze lingered, and a
look came into his eyes that stimulated David&#8217;s
passion for romance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s remembering,&#8221; he thought joyfully.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t hesitate even an instant. He
stopped in front of the Judge and extended the
flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like these roses, Judge Thorne?&#8221;
he asked courteously.</p>
<p>Then for the first time the Judge&#8217;s attention
was diverted from the flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face is familiar, my lad, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is David Dunne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure, but it must be four years
or more since I last saw you. How&#8217;s your
mother getting along?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s face paled.</p>
<p>&#8220;She died three weeks ago,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my lad,&#8221; he exclaimed in shocked tones,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know! I only returned last night
from a long journey. But with whom are you
living?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Aunt M&#8217;ri and Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>The impressive silence following this exclamation
was broken by the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you offer me these flowers, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt M&#8217;ri picked them and told me to give
them to some one who looked as if they needed
flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge eyed him with the keen scrutiny of
the trained lawyer, but the boy&#8217;s face was non-committal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up into my office with me, David,&#8221;
commanded the Judge, turning quickly into a
near-by stairway. David followed up the stairs
and into a suite of well-appointed offices.</p>
<p>A clerk looked up in surprise at the sight of
the dignified judge carrying a bouquet of old-fashioned
roses and accompanied by a country
lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mathews. I am engaged, if
any one comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He preceded David into a room on whose
outer door was the deterrent word, &#8220;Private.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Judge got a pitcher of water to
hold the flowers David crossed the room. On
a table near the window was a rack of books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
which he eagerly inspected. To his delight he
saw a volume of Andersen&#8217;s Fairy Tales. Instantly
the book was opened, and he was devouring
a story.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; spoke the Judge from the other end
of the room, &#8220;didn&#8217;t these roses grow on a bush
by the west porch?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>The Judge, remarking the boy&#8217;s absorption,
came to see what he was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andersen&#8217;s Fairy Tales! My favorite book.
I didn&#8217;t know that boys liked fairy stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>David looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that lawyers did, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do, David. They are my most delightful
diversion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls don&#8217;t like fairy stories,&#8221; mused David.
&#8220;Anyway, Janey doesn&#8217;t. I have to tell true
stories to please her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a yarner, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted David modestly. &#8220;Aunt
M&#8217;ri thinks I will be a writer when I grow up,
but I think I should like to be a lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; asked the Judge abruptly, &#8220;did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
Miss Brumble tell you to give me those roses?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a wild flashing of eyes the Dunne temper
awoke, and the boy&#8217;s under jaw shot
forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he answered fiercely. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
know that I know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused in mid-channel of such deep
waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you know what?&#8221; demanded the Judge
in his cross-examining tone.</p>
<p>David was doubtful of the consequences of
his temerity, but he stood his ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you what, because I promised
not to. Some one was just thinking out loud,
and I overheard.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, I remember your father telling me,
years ago, that he had a little son with a big imagination
which his mother fed by telling stories
every night at bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me,&#8221; asked David earnestly,
&#8220;about my father? What was it he did? Uncle
Barnabas told me something about his trouble
last Saturday.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How did he come to mention your father to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>David reddened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud twitted me about my mother taking in
washing and about my father being a convict,
and I knocked him down. I told him I would
kill him. Uncle Barnabas pulled me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he let us fight it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you licked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied the boy, with proud
modesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;You naturally would, with that under jaw,
but it&#8217;s the animal in us that makes us want to
kill, and the man in us should rise above the
animal. I think I am the person to tell you
about your father. He had every reason to
make good, but he was unfortunate in his choice
of associates and he acquired some of their
habits. He had a violent temper, and one night
when he was&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drunk,&#8221; supplied David gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;He became angry with one of his friends
and tried to kill him. Your father was given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
a comparatively short sentence, which he had
almost served when he died. You must guard
against your temper and cultivate patience and
endurance&ndash;&ndash;qualities your mother possessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It suddenly and overwhelmingly flashed
across David what need his mother must have
had for such traits, and he turned away to force
back his tears. The Judge saw the heaving of
the slender, square, young shoulders, and the
gray eyes that were wont to look so coldly upon
the world and its people grew soft and surprisingly
moist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s past now, David, and can&#8217;t be helped,
but you are going to aim to be the kind of man
your mother would want you to be. You must
learn to put up with Jud&#8217;s tyranny because his
father and his aunt are your benefactors. I
have been away the greater part of the time
since your father&#8217;s death, or I should have kept
track of you and your mother. Every time you
come to town I want you to come up here and
report to me. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. And I will bring you some
more flowers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar wuz you, Dave, all the time we
wuz in town?&#8221; asked Barnabas, as they
drove homeward.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Judge Thorne&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Thorne&#8217;s office! What fer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me there, Uncle Barnabas. He
was my father&#8217;s lawyer once, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he wuz. I hed fergot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He warned me against my temper, as you
did, and he told me&ndash;&ndash;all about my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad he did, Dave. He wuz the one
to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says that every time I come to Lafferton
I must come up and report to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, it does beat all how folks take
to you. Thar wuz Joe wanted you, and now
Mart Thorne&#8217;s interested. Mebby they could
do better by you than we could. Joe&#8217;s rich, and
the Jedge is well fixed and almighty smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied David stoutly. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
stay with you, Uncle Barnabas. There&#8217;s
something you&#8217;ve got much more of than they
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Dave?&#8221; asked Barnabas curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horse sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas looked pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, I callate to do my best fer you,
and thar&#8217;s one thing I want <i>you</i> to git some
horse sense about right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Uncle Barnabas. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feedin&#8217; on them fairy stories all day. They
hain&#8217;t hullsome diet fer a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Judge reads them,&#8221; protested David.
&#8220;He has that same book of fairy stories that
Joe gave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve done all the Jedge has, and
git to whar you kin afford to be idle, you kin
read any stuff you want ter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I read them at all?&#8221; asked David in
alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you kin. I meant, I didn&#8217;t want
you stickin&#8217; to &#8217;em like a pup to a root. You&#8217;re
goin&#8217; down to the fields to begin work with me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
this arternoon, and you won&#8217;t feel much like
readin&#8217; to-night. I wuz lookin&#8217; over them books
of your&#8217;n last night. Thar&#8217;s one you&#8217;d best
start in on right away, and give the fairies a
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life of Lincoln. That&#8217;ll show you what
work will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll read it aloud to you, Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the bridge that spanned
the river Old Hundred dropped the little hurrying
gait which he assumed in town, and settled
down to his normal, comfortable, country jog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas,&#8221; said David thoughtfully,
&#8220;what is your religion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas meditated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, I don&#8217;t know as I hev what you
might call religion exackly. I b&#8217;lieve in payin&#8217;
a hundred cents on the dollar, and a-helpin&#8217; the
man that&#8217;s down, and&ndash;&ndash;wal, I s&#8217;pose I come
as nigh bein&#8217; a Unitarian as anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The distribution of the purchases now began.
Sometimes the good housewife, herself, came
out to receive the parcels and to hear the latest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
news from town. Oftener, the children of the
household were the messengers, for Barnabas&#8217;
pockets were always well filled with candy on
town days. At one place Barnabas stopped
at a barn by the roadside and surreptitiously
deposited a suspicious looking package. When
he was in front of the next farmhouse a man
came out with anxious mien.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Fred!&#8221; hailed Barnabas with a
knowing wink. &#8220;I was afeerd you&#8217;d not be on
the watchout. I left it in the manger.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not reach the farm until the dinner
hour, and the conversation was maintained by
M&#8217;ri and Barnabas on marketing matters.
David spent the afternoon in being initiated in
field work. At supper, M&#8217;ri asked him suddenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom did you give the flowers, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a story to it, Aunt M&#8217;ri, and
I&#8217;m going to tell it to Janey. Then you can
hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri smiled, and questioned him no further.</p>
<p>When the day was done and the &#8220;still hour&#8221;
had come, Janey and David, hand in hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
came around the house and sat down at her feet.
It was seldom that any one intruded at this
hour, but she knew that David had come to tell
his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begin, Davey,&#8221; urged Janey impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, when a boy was going to town,
his aunt gave him a big bouquet of pink roses.
She told him to give them to some one who
looked as if they needed flowers. So when the
boy got to town he walked up Main Street and
looked at every one he met. He hoped to see
a little sick child or a tired woman who had no
flowers of her own; but every one seemed to be
in a hurry, and very few stopped to look at
flowers or anything else. Those that did look
turned away as if they did not see them, and
some seemed to be thinking, &#8216;What beautiful
flowers!&#8217; and then forgot them.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last he met a tall, stern man dressed in
fine clothes. He looked very proud, but as if
he were tired of everything. When he saw the
flowers he didn&#8217;t turn away, but kept his eyes
on them as if they made him sad and lonesome
in thinking of good times that were over. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the boy asked him if he would not like the
flowers. The man looked surprised and asked
the boy what his name was. When he heard it,
he remembered that he had been attorney for
the boy&#8217;s father. He took him up into an
office marked private, and he gave the boy some
good advice, and talked to him about his
mother, which made the boy feel bad. But the
man comforted him and told him that every
time he came to town he was to report to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri had sat motionless during the recital of
this story. At its close she did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t much of a story. Let&#8217;s go
play,&#8221; suggested Janey, relieving the tension.</p>
<p>They were off like a flash. David heard his
name faintly called. M&#8217;ri&#8217;s voice sounded far
off, and as if there were tears in it, but he
lacked the courage to return.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>Two important events calendared the next
week. The school year ended and Pennyroyal,
the &#8220;hired help,&#8221; who had been paying
her annual visit to her sister, came back to the
farm. There are two kinds of housekeepers,
the &#8220;make-cleans&#8221; and the &#8220;keep-cleans.&#8221;
Pennyroyal was a graduate of both classes. Her
ruling passions in life were scrubbing and &#8220;redding&#8221;
up. On the day of her return, after
making onslaught on house and porches, she
attacked the pump, and planned a sand-scouring
siege for the morrow on the barn. In
appearance she was a true exponent of soap and
water, and always had the look of being freshly
laundered.</p>
<p>At first Pennyroyal looked with ill favor on
the addition that had been made to the household
in her absence, but when David submitted
to the shampooing of his tousled mass of hair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
and offered no protest when she scrubbed his
neck, she became reconciled to his presence.</p>
<p>On a &#8220;town day&#8221; David, carrying a huge
bunch of pinks, paid his second visit to the
Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she tell you,&#8221; asked the tall man, gazing
very hard at the landscape without the open
window, &#8220;to give these flowers to some one who
needed them?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a perilous little pause. Then there
flashed from the boy to the man a gaze of comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;She picked them for you,&#8221; was the response,
simply spoken.</p>
<p>The Judge carefully selected a blossom for
his buttonhole, and then proceeded to draw
David out. Under the skillful, schooled questioning,
David grew communicative.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s always on the west porch after supper.&#8221;
He added na&iuml;vely: &#8220;That&#8217;s the time when
Uncle Barnabas smokes on the east porch, Jud
goes off with the boys, and I play with Janey
in the lane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, David,&#8221; acknowledged the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Judge gratefully. &#8220;You are quite a bureau of
information, and,&#8221; in a consciously casual tone,
&#8220;will you take a note to your aunt? I think I
will ride out to the farm to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s young heart fluttered, and he went
back to the farm invested with a proud feeling
of having assisted the fates. The air was filled
with mystery and an undercurrent of excitement
that day. After David had delivered the
auspicious note, a private conference behind
closed doors had been held between M&#8217;ri and
Barnabas in the &#8220;company parlor.&#8221; David&#8217;s
shrewd young eyes noted the weakening of the
lines of finality about M&#8217;ri&#8217;s mouth when she
emerged from the interview. Throughout the
long afternoon she performed the usual tasks in
nervous haste, the color coming and going in her
delicately contoured face.</p>
<p>When she appeared at the supper table she
was adorned in white, brightened by touches of
blue at belt and collar. David&#8217;s young eyes surveyed
her appraisingly and approvingly, and
later he effected a thorough effacing of the family.
He obtained from Barnabas permission for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Jud to go to town with the Gardner boys. His
next diplomatic move was to persuade Pennyroyal
to go with himself and Janey to Uncle
Larimy&#8217;s hermit home. When she wavered, he
commented on the eclipse of Uncle Larimy&#8217;s
windows the last time he saw them. That
turned the tide of Pennyroyal&#8217;s resistance.
Equipped with soft linen, a cake of strong soap,
and a bottle of ammonia, she strode down the
lane, accompanied by the children.</p>
<p>The walk proved a trying ordeal for Pennyroyal.
She started out at her accustomed brisk
gait, but David loitered and sauntered, Janey
of course setting her pace by his. Pennyroyal,
feeling it incumbent upon herself to keep
watch of her young companions, retraced her
steps so often that she covered the distance several
times.</p>
<p>At Uncle Larimy&#8217;s she found such a fertile
field for her line of work that David was quite
ready to return when she pronounced her labors
finished. She was really tired, and quite willing
to walk home slowly in the moonlight.</p>
<p>It was very quiet. Here and there a bird,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
startled from its hiding place, sought refuge in
the higher branches. A pensive quail piped an
answer to the trilling call from the meadows. A
tree toad uttered his lonely, guttural exclamation.
The air, freshening with a coming covey
of clouds, swayed the tops of the trees with
mournful sound.</p>
<p>David, full of dreams, let his fancy have full
play, and he made a little story of his own about
the meeting of the lovers. He pictured the
Judge riding down the dust-white road as the
sunset shadows grew long. He knew the exact
spot&ndash;&ndash;the last bit of woodland&ndash;&ndash;from where
Martin, across level-lying fields, could obtain
his first glimpse of the old farmhouse and porch.
His moving-picture conceit next placed M&#8217;ri,
dressed in white, with touches of blue, on the
west porch. He had decided that in the
Long Ago Days she had been wont to wear
blue, which he imagined to be the Judge&#8217;s
favorite color. Then he caused the unimpressionable
Judge to tie his horse to the hitching
post at the side of the road and walk between
the hedges of sweet peas that bordered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the path. Their pink and white sweetness was
the trumpet call sounding over the grave of the
love of his youth. (David had read such a passage
in a book at Miss Rhody&#8217;s and thought it
very fine and applicable.) His active fancy
took Martin Thorne around the house to the
west porch. The white figure arose, and in the
purple-misted twilight he saw the touches of
blue, and his heart lighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old name, the name he had given her in
his love-making days, came to his lips. (David
couldn&#8217;t make M&#8217;ri fit in with the settings of his
story, so he re-christened her.) She came forward
with outstretched hand and a gentle manner,
but at the look in his eyes as he uttered the
old name, with the caressing accent on the first
syllable, she understood. A deep sunrise color
flooded her face and neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221; she whispered as she came to him.</p>
<p>David threw back his head and shut his eyes
in ecstatic bliss. He was rudely roused from his
romantic weaving by the sound of Barnabas&#8217;
chuckle as they came to the east porch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You must a washed every one of Larimy&#8217;s
winders!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Janey, &#8220;and she mopped his
floors, washed and clean-papered the shelves,
and wanted to scrub the old gray horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pennyroyal,&#8221; exclaimed Barnabas gravely,
&#8220;I wonder you ain&#8217;t waterlogged!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pennyroyal&#8217;d rather be clean than be President,&#8221;
averred David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s M&#8217;ri?&#8221; demanded Pennyroyal, ignoring
these thrusts.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the west porch, entertaining company,&#8221;
remarked Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pennyroyal never used a superfluous word.
Joe Forbes said she talked like telegrams.</p>
<p>Barnabas removed his pipe from his mouth,
and paused to give his words greater dramatic
force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mart Thorne!&#8221;</p>
<p>The effect was satisfactory.</p>
<p>Pennyroyal stood as if petrified for a moment.
Than she expressed her feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>Her tone made the exclamation as impressive
as a benediction.</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri visited the bedside of each of her
charges that night. Jud and Janey were in the
land of dreams, but David was awake, expecting
her coming. There was a new tenderness
in her good-night kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt M&#8217;ri,&#8221; asked the boy, looking up with
his deep, searching eyes and a suspicion of a
smile about his lips, &#8220;did you and Judge Thorne
talk over my education? He said that he was
going to speak to you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, the Judge is coming to dinner Sunday.
We will talk it over with you then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt M&#8217;ri,&#8221; a little note of wistfulness chasing
the bantering look from his eyes, &#8220;you aren&#8217;t
going to leave us now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a year, David,&#8221; she said, a soft flush
coming to her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s waited seven,&#8221; thought David, &#8220;so one
more won&#8217;t make so much difference. Anyway,
we need a year to get used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, David was only a boy. His flights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
of romantic fancy vanished in remembrance of
the blissful certainty that there would be ice
cream for dinner on Sunday next and on many
Sundays thereafter.

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>The little trickle of uneven days was broken
one morning by a message which was
brought by the &#8220;hired man from Randall&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got visitors from the city tew our
house,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;They want you to send
Janey over tew play with their little gal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Befitting the honor of the occasion, Janey was
attired in her blue-sprigged muslin and allowed
to wear the turquoises. David drove her to
Maplewood, the pretentious home of the Randalls,
intending to call for her later. When they
came to the entrance of the grounds at the end
of a long avenue of maples a very tiny girl, immaculate
in white, with hair of gold and eyes
darkly blue, came out from among the trees.
She regarded David with deep, grave eyes as he
stepped from the wagon to open the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come to play with me,&#8221; she stated
in a tone of assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought Janey to play with you,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
rejoined, indicating his little companion. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ll get in the wagon, I&#8217;ll drive you up to the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held up her slender little arms to him, and
David felt as if he were lifting a doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name in Carey Winthrop. What is
yours?&#8221; she demanded of Janey as they all rode
up the shaded, graveled road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Janey Brumble,&#8221; replied the visitor, gaining
ease from the ingenuousness of the little girl
and from the knowledge that she was older than
her hostess.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s your brother?&#8221; indicating David.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my adopted brother,&#8221; said Janey;
&#8220;he&#8217;s David Dunne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a &#8217;dopted brother,&#8221; sighed the
little girl, eying David wistfully.</p>
<p>David drove up to the side entrance of the
large, white-columned, porticoed house, on the
spacious veranda of which sat a fair-haired
young woman with luminous eyes and smiling
mouth. The smile deepened as she saw the curiously
disfigured horse ambling up to the stone
step.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, Old Hundred!&#8221; commanded David,
whereupon the smile became a rippling laugh.
David got out, lifted the little girl to the ground
very carefully, and gave a helping hand to
the nimble, independent Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; cried Carey delightedly, &#8220;this is
Janey and her &#8217;dopted brother David.&#8221;</p>
<p>David touched his cap gravely in acknowledgment
of the introduction. He had never heard
his name pronounced as this little girl spoke
it, with the soft &#8220;a.&#8221; It sounded very sweet to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive back for you before sundown,
Janey,&#8221; said David, preparing to climb into the
wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; objected Carey, regarding him with
apprehension, &#8220;I want you to stay and play with
me. Tell him to stay, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a regal carriage to the little head
and an imperious note&ndash;&ndash;the note of an only
child&ndash;&ndash;in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe David has other things to do than to
play with little girls,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;but,
David, if you can stay, I wish you would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to stay,&#8221; replied David earnestly,
&#8220;but they expect me back, and Old Hundred
is needed in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luke can drive your horse back, and we will
see that you and Janey ride home.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Carey, with a hand to each of her new
playmates, led them across the driveway to the
rolling stretch of shaded lawn. The lady
watched David as he submitted to be driven as
a horse by the little girls and then constituted
himself driver to his little team of ponies as he
called them. Later, when they raced to the
meadow, she saw him hold Janey back that Carey
might win. Presently the lady was joined by
her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Carey?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is having great sport with a pretty little
girl and a guardian angel of a boy. Here they
come!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were trooping across the lawn, the little
girls adorned with blossom wreaths which David
had woven for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;May we go down to the woods&ndash;&ndash;the big
woods?&#8221; asked Carey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too far for you to walk, dear,&#8221; remonstrated
her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;David says he&#8217;ll draw me in my little cart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it that was afraid to go into the big
woods, and thought it was a forest filled with
wild beasts and scary things?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Winthrop.</p>
<p>The earnest eyes fixed on his were not at all
abashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;With him, with David,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;I
would have no afraidments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraidments?&#8221; he repeated perplexedly. &#8220;I
am not sure I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease, Arthur; it&#8217;s a very good word,&#8221;
interposed Mrs. Winthrop quickly. &#8220;It seems
to have a different meaning from fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up here, David,&#8221; bade Mr. Winthrop,
&#8220;and let me see what there is in you to inspire
one with no &#8216;afraidments&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy came up on the steps, and did not
falter under the keen but good-humored gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like to play with little girls, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to play with these little girls,&#8221; admitted
David.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you like to do besides that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a hunter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I like to shoot at a mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to read, and fish, and swim, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat ice cream!&#8221; finished Janey roguishly,
showing her dimples.</p>
<p>The man caught her up in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a darling, and I wish my little girl
had such rosy cheeks. David, can you show me
where there is good fishing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Larimy can show you the best places.
He knows where the bass live, and how to coax
them to bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you take me to this wonderful person
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey now came out of the hall with her cart,
and David drew her across the lawn, Janey dancing
by his side. Down through the meadows
wound a wheel-tracked road leading to a patch
of dense woods which, to a little girl with a big
imagination, could easily become a wild forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
infested with all sorts of nameless terrors&ndash;&ndash;terrors
that make one draw the bedclothes snugly
over the head at night. She gave a little frightened
cry as they came into the cool, olive depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid, David. Take me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted her to his shoulder, and her soft
cheek nestled against his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are not afraid,&#8221; he said persuasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I would be if you put me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went farther into the oak depths, until
they came to a fallen tree where they rested.
Janey, investigating the forestry, finally discovered
a bush with slender red twigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;now David will show you
what beautiful things he can make for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no pins,&#8221; demurred David.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; triumphantly producing a paper of
the needful from her pocket. &#8220;I always carry
them now.&#8221;</p>
<p>David broke up the long twigs into short
pieces, from which he skillfully fashioned little
chairs and tables, discoursing the while to Carey
on the beauty and safety of the woods. Finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Carey acquired courage to hunt for wild flowers,
though her hand remained close in David&#8217;s
clasp.</p>
<p>When they returned to the house Carey gave a
glowing account of the expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down on the steps and rest, children,&#8221;
proposed Mrs. Winthrop, &#8220;while Lucy prepares
a little picnic dinner for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will we do now, David?&#8221; appealed
Carey, when they were seated on the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t do anything but sit still,&#8221; admonished
her mother. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done more now
than you are used to doing in one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Davey will tell us a story,&#8221; suggested Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, please, David,&#8221; urged Carey, coming to
him and resting her eyes on his inquiringly, while
her little hand confidently sought his knee.
Instinctively and naturally his fingers closed
upon it.</p>
<p>Embarrassed as he was at having a strange
audience, he could not resist the child&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll like the kind that you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said
musingly to Janey, &#8220;the kind about fairies and
princes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; rejoined Carey.</p>
<p>So he fashioned a tale, partly from recollections
of Andersen but mostly from his own
fancy. As his imagination kindled, he forgot
where he was. Inspired by the spellbound interest
of the dainty little girl with the worshiping
eyes, he achieved his masterpiece.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Winthrop,
&#8220;you are a veritable Scheherazade! You didn&#8217;t
make up that story yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only part of it,&#8221; admitted David modestly.</p>
<p>When he and Janey started for home David
politely delivered M&#8217;ri&#8217;s message of invitation
for Carey to come to the farm on the morrow to
play.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is going to be lovely here,&#8221; said the little
girl happily. &#8220;And we are going to come every
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janey kissed her impulsively. &#8220;Good-by,
Carey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Janey. Good-by, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he returned cheerily. Looking
back, he saw her lips trembling. His gaze
turned in perplexity to Mrs. Winthrop, whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
eyes were dancing. &#8220;She expects you to bid her
good-by the way Janey did,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said David, reddening, as two baby lips
of scarlet were lifted naturally and expectantly
to his.</p>
<p>As they drove away, the light feet of the
horse making but little sound on the smooth
road, Mrs. Winthrop&#8217;s clear treble was wafted
after them.</p>
<p>&#8220;One can scarcely believe that his father was
a convict and his mother a washerwoman.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lump came into the boy&#8217;s throat. Janey
was very quiet on the way home. When they
were alone she said to him, with troubled eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Davey, is Carey going to be your sweetheart?&#8221;</p>
<p>His laugh was reassuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Janey, I am just twice her age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is like a little doll, isn&#8217;t she, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; like a little princess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Little Teacher came to
show them her present from Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he chose a camera so I could take
your pictures to send to him,&#8221; she declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rhody wants her picture taken in the
black silk Joe gave her. If you will take it, she
won&#8217;t have to spend the money he sent her,&#8221;
said the thoughtful David.</p>
<p>Little Teacher was very enthusiastic over this
proposition, and offered to accompany him at
once to secure the picture. Miss Rhody was
greatly excited over the event. Ever since the
dress had been finished she had been a devotee
at the shrine of two hooks in her closet from
which was suspended the long-coveted garment,
waiting for an occasion that would warrant its
d&eacute;b&ucirc;t. She nervously dressed for the &#8220;likeness,&#8221;
for which she assumed her primmest pose.
A week later David sent Joe a picture of Miss
Rhody standing stiff and straight on her back
porch and arrayed, with all the glory of the
lilies of the field, in her new silk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>When the hot, close-cropped fields took
on their first suggestion of autumn and a
fuller note was heard in the requiem of the songbirds,
when the twilights were of purple and the
morning skies delicately mackereled in gray,
David entered the little, red, country schoolhouse.
M&#8217;ri&#8217;s tutelage and his sedulous application
to Jud&#8217;s schoolbooks saved him from the
ignominy of being classified with the younger
children.</p>
<p>When he sat down to the ink-stained, pen-scratched
desk that was to be his own, when he
made compact piles of his new books and placed
in the little groove in front of the inkwell his pen,
pencils, and ruler, he turned to Little Teacher
such a glowing face of ecstasy that she was quite
inspired, and her sympathies and energies were
at once enlisted in the cause of David&#8217;s education.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a new world for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
He studied with a concentration that made him
oblivious to all that occurred about him, and he
had to be reminded of calls to recitations by an
individual summons. He fairly overwhelmed
Little Teacher by his voracity for learning and
a perseverance that vanquished all obstacles.
He soon outstripped his class, and finally his
young instructress was forced to bring forth her
own textbooks to satisfy his avidity. He devoured
them all speedily, and she then applied to
the Judge for fuel from his library to feed her
young furnace.</p>
<p>&#8220;He takes to learning as naturally as bees to
blossoms,&#8221; she reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must ease off,&#8221; warned Barnabas.
&#8220;Young hickory needs plenty of room for full
growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; disagreed the Judge, &#8220;young hickory is
as strong as wrought iron. He&#8217;s going to have
a clear, keen mind to argue law cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said M&#8217;ri. &#8220;You forget another
quality of young hickory. No other wood burns
with such brilliancy. David is going to be an
author.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; wrote Joe, &#8220;that Dave won&#8217;t be
a first-class ranchman. He must be plum locoed
with dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>This prognostication reached David&#8217;s ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without dreams,&#8221; he argued to Barnabas,
&#8220;one would be like the pigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, now, Dave, mebby pigs dream. They
sartain sleep a hull lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>David laughed appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; pursued Barnabas, &#8220;they&#8217;re all figgerin&#8217;
on your futur, and they&#8217;re a-figgerin&#8217;
wrong. Joe thinks you&#8217;ll take to ranchin&#8217;. You
may&ndash;&ndash;fer a spell. M&#8217;ri thinks you may write
books. You may do even that&ndash;&ndash;fer a spell. The
Jedge counts on yer takin&#8217; to the law like a duck
does to water. You may, but law larnin&#8217;, cow
punchin&#8217;, and story writin&#8217; &#8217;ll jest be steppin&#8217;
stuns to what I know you air goin&#8217; ter be, and
what I know is in you ter be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is that, Uncle Barnabas?&#8221;
asked David in surprise. &#8220;A farmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farmer, nuthin&#8217;!&#8221; scoffed Barnabas. &#8220;Yer
hain&#8217;t much on farmin&#8217;, Dave, though I will
say yer furrers is allers straight, like everythin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
else you do. Yer straight yerself. No! young
hickory can bend without breakin&#8217;, and thar&#8217;s
jest one thing I want fer you to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; persisted the boy.</p>
<p>Barnabas whispered something.</p>
<p>The blood of the young country boy went like
wine through his veins; his heart leaped with a
big and mighty purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, remember, Dave,&#8221; cautioned Barnabas,
&#8220;what all work and no play done to Jack.
You git yer lessons perfect, and recite them,
and read a leetle of an evenin&#8217;; the rest of the
time I want yer to get out and cerkilate.&#8221;</p>
<p>November with its call to quiet woods came
on, and David was eager to &#8220;cerkilate.&#8221; He
became animated with the spirit of sport. Red-letter
Saturdays were spent with Uncle Larimy,
and the far-away echo of the hunter&#8217;s bullet and
the scudding through the woods of startled game
became new, sweet music to his ears. Rifle in
hand, with dog shuffling at his heels or plunging
ahead in search of game, the world was his. Life
was very full and happy, save for the one inevitable
sprig of bitter&ndash;&ndash;Jud! The big bully of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
a boy had learned that David was his equal physically
and his superior mentally, but the fear of
David and of David&#8217;s good standing kept him
from venturing out in the open; so from cover
he sought by all the arts known to craftiness to
harass the younger boy, whose patience this test
tried most sorely.</p>
<p>One day when Little Teacher had given him
a verbose definition of the word &#8220;pestiferous,&#8221;
David looked at her comprehendingly. &#8220;Like
Jud,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>Many a time his young arms ached to give Jud
another thrashing, but his mother&#8217;s parting injunction
restrained him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;Jud belonged to some
one else!&#8221;</p>
<p>He vainly sought to find the hair line that
divided his sense of gratitude and his protection
of self-respect.</p>
<p>Winter followed, and the farm work droned.
It was a comfortable, cozy time, with breakfast
served in the kitchen on a table spread with a
gay, red cloth. Pennyroyal baked griddle-sized
cakes, delivering them one at a time direct from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the stove to the consumer. The early hour of
lamplight made long evenings, which were beguiled
by lesson books and story-books, by an
occasional skating carnival on the river, a coasting
party at Long Hill, or a &#8220;surprise&#8221; on some
hospitable neighbor.</p>
<p>One morning he came into school with face
and eyes aglow with something more than the
mere delight of living. It meant mischief, pure
and simple, but Little Teacher was not always
discerning. She gave him a welcoming smile of
sheer sympathy with his mood. She didn&#8217;t
smile, later, when the schoolroom was distracted
by the sound of raucous laughter, feminine
screams, and a fluttering of skirts as the girls
scrambled to standing posture in their chairs.
Astonished, she looked for the cause. The cause
came her way, and the pupils had a fresh example
of the miracles wrought by a mouse, for
Little Teacher, usually the personification of
dignity and repose, screamed lustily and scudded
chairward with as much rapidity as that displayed
by the scurrying mouse as it chased for
the corner and disappeared through a knothole.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>As soon as the noiseful glee had subsided,
Little Teacher sought to recover her prided self-possession.
In a voice resonant with sternness,
she commanded silence, gazing wrathfully by
chance at little Tim Wiggins.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T was David done it,&#8221; he said in deprecating
self-defense, imagining himself accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne,&#8221; demanded Little Teacher,
&#8220;did you bring that mouse to school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He brung it and let it out on purpose,&#8221; informed
Tim eagerly.</p>
<p>Little Teacher never encouraged talebearing,
but she was so discomfited by the exposure of
the ruling weakness peculiar to her sex that she
decided to discipline her favorite pupil upon his
acknowledgment of guilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may bring your books and sit on the
platform,&#8221; she ordered indignantly.</p>
<p>David did not in the least mind his assignment
to so prominent a position, but he did mind Little
Teacher&#8217;s attitude toward him throughout the
day. He sought to propitiate her by coming to
her assistance in many little tasks, but she persistently
ignored his overtures. He then ventured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
to seek enlightenment regarding his studies, but
she coldly informed him he could remain after
school to ask his questions.</p>
<p>David began to feel troubled, and looked out
of the window for an inspiration. He found
one in the form of big, brawny, Jim Block&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Teacher&#8217;s
Jim,&#8221; as the school children all called
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes Teacher&#8217;s Jim,&#8221; sang David,
<i>soto voce</i>.</p>
<p>The shot told. For the second time that day
Little Teacher showed outward and visible
signs of an inward disturbance. With a blush
she turned quickly to the window and watched
with expressive eyes the stalwart figure striding
over the rough-frozen road.</p>
<p>In an instant, however, she had recalled herself
to earth, and David&#8217;s dancing eyes renewed
her hostility toward him. Toward the end of
the day she began to feel somewhat appeased by
his docility and evident repentance. Her manner
had perceptibly changed by the time the
closing exercise began. This was the writing of
words on the blackboard for the pupils to use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
in sentences. She pointed to the first word, &#8220;income.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can make a sentence and use that word
correctly?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do call on Tim,&#8221; whispered David. &#8220;He so
loves to be the first to tell anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled her appreciation of Tim&#8217;s prominent
characteristic, and looked at the youngster,
who was wringing his hand in an agony of
eagerness. She gave him the floor, and he
jumped to his feet in triumph, yelling:</p>
<p>&#8220;In come a mouse!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was too much for David&#8217;s composure,
and he gave way to an infectious fit of laughter,
in which the pupils joined.</p>
<p>Little Teacher found the allusion personal
and uncomfortable. She at once assumed her
former distant mien, demanding David&#8217;s presence
after school closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no gratitude, David,&#8221; she stated
emphatically.</p>
<p>The boy winced, and his eyes darkened with
concern, as he remembered his mother&#8217;s parting
injunction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Little Teacher softened slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sorry, aren&#8217;t you, David?&#8221; she asked
gently.</p>
<p>He looked at her meditatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Teacher,&#8221; he answered quietly.</p>
<p>She flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne, you may go home, and you
needn&#8217;t come back to school again until you tell
me you are sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>David took his books and walked serenely
from the room. He went home by the way of
Jim Block&#8217;s farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Dave!&#8221; called Big Jim, who was in
the barnyard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jim! I came to tell you some good
news. You said if you were only sure there was
something Teacher was afraid of, you wouldn&#8217;t
feel so scared of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; prompted Jim eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d find out for you, so I took a
mouse to school and let it loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>David then related the occurrences of the
morning, not omitting the look in Little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Teacher&#8217;s eyes when she beheld Jim from the
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hook up this very night and go to see
her,&#8221; confided Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure you do, Jim. If you find your courage
slipping, just remember that you owe it to
me, because she won&#8217;t let me come back to school
unless she knows why I wasn&#8217;t sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you my word, Dave,&#8221; said Jim earnestly.</p>
<p>The next morning Little Teacher stopped at
the Brumble farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came this way to walk to school with you
and Janey,&#8221; she said sweetly and significantly
to David.</p>
<p>When they reached the road, and Janey had
gone back to get her sled, Little Teacher looked
up and caught the amused twinkle in David&#8217;s
eye. A wave of conscious red overspread her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I say I am sorry now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne, there are things you understand
which you never learned from books.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>Late spring brought preparations for
M&#8217;ri&#8217;s wedding. Rhody Crabbe&#8217;s needle
and fingers flew in rapturous speed, and there
was likewise engaged a seamstress from Lafferton.
Rhody had begged for the making of the
wedding gown, and when it was finished David
went to fetch it home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost done, David, and you tell M&#8217;ri
the last stitch was a loveknot. It&#8217;s most a year
sence you wuz here afore, a-waitin&#8217; fer her
blue waist tew be finished. Remember, don&#8217;t
you, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>He remembered, and as she stitched he sat
silently reviewing that year, the comforts received,
the pleasures pursued, and, best of all,
the many things he had learned, but the recollection
that a year ago his mother had been living
brought a rush of sad memories and blotted out
happier thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish yer ma could hev seen Mart and M&#8217;ri
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
merried. She was orful disapp&#8217;inted when they
broke off.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reply. Rhody&#8217;s sharp little
eyes, in upward glance, spied the trickling tear;
she looked quickly away and stitched in furious
haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my!&#8221; she continued, as if there had been
no pause, &#8220;how glad she would be to know &#8217;t was
you as fetched it around.&#8221;</p>
<p>David looked up, diverted and inquiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I learnt it from M&#8217;ri. She told me
about the flowers you give him. I thought it
was jest sweet in you, David. You done good
work thar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rhody,&#8221; said David earnestly, &#8220;maybe
some day I can get you a sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T ain&#8217;t no use, David,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;No
one wants a plain critter like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of them don&#8217;t marry for looks,&#8221; argued
David sagely. &#8220;Besides, you look fine in your
black silk, and your hair crimped. Joe thinks
your picture is great. He&#8217;s got it on a shelf
over his fireplace at the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most likely some cowboy&#8217;ll see it and lose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
his heart,&#8221; laughed Miss Rhody, &#8220;but thar, the
weddin&#8217; dress is all done. You go home and
quit thinkin&#8217; about gittin&#8217; me a man. I ain&#8217;t
ha&#8217;nted by the thought of endin&#8217; single.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great preparations for the wedding progressed
at the Brumble farm. For a week
Pennyroyal whipped up eggs and sugar, and
David ransacked the woods for evergreens and
berries with which to decorate the big barn,
where the dance after the wedding was to take
place.</p>
<p>The old farmhouse was filled to overflowing
on the night of the wedding. After the ceremony,
Miss Rhody, resplendent in the black
silk and waving hair loosed from the crimping
pins that had confined it for two days and
nights, came up to David.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, David, I&#8217;ve got the funniest all over
feelin&#8217; from seein&#8217; Mart and M&#8217;ri merried! I
was orful afeerd I&#8217;d cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Miss Rhody,&#8221; said David, gallantly
bringing her a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t M&#8217;ri look perfeckly beyewtiful?&#8221;
she continued, after accomplishing the pirouette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
that prevented creases. &#8220;And Mart, he looked
that proud, and solemn too. It made me think
of that gal when she spoke &#8216;Curfew shall not ring
tewnight&#8217; at the schoolhouse. Every one looks
fine. I hain&#8217;t seen Barnabas so fussed up sence
Libby Sukes&#8217; funyral. It makes him look real
spry. And whoever got Larimer Sasser to perk
up and put on a starched shirt!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; confided David, &#8220;that Penny got
after him. She had him in a corner when he
came, and she tied his necktie so tight I was
afraid she would choke him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at old Miss Pankey, David. She, as
rich as they make &#8217;em, and a-wearin&#8217; that old
silk! It looks as ef it hed bin hung up fer you
and Jud to shoot at. Ain&#8217;t she a-glarin&#8217; and
a-sniffin&#8217; at me, though? Say, David, you write
Joe that if M&#8217;ri did look the purtiest of any one
that my dress cost more&#8217;n any one&#8217;s here, and
showed it, too. I hope thar&#8217;ll be a lot of occasions
to wear it to this summer. M&#8217;ri is a-goin&#8217;
to give a reception when she gits back from her
tower, and that&#8217;ll be one thing to wear it at.
Ain&#8217;t Jud got a mean look? He&#8217;s as crooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
as a dog&#8217;s hind leg. But, say, David, that&#8217;s a
fine suit you&#8217;re a-wearin&#8217;. You look handsome.
Thar ain&#8217;t a stingy hair on Barnabas&#8217; head.
He&#8217;s doin&#8217; jest as good by you as he is by Jud.
Don&#8217;t little Janey look like an angel in white,
and them lovely beads Joe give her? I can&#8217;t
think of nothin&#8217; else but that little Eva you read
me about. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder a bit, David, if
I come to yer and Janey&#8217;s weddin&#8217; yet!&#8221; she said,
as Janey came dancing up to them.</p>
<p>A slow flush mounted to his forehead, but
Janey laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve promised Joe I&#8217;d wait for him,&#8221; she
said roguishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only foolin&#8217; and so wuz he,&#8221; quickly
spoke Miss Rhody, seeing the hurt look in
David&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Barnabas,&#8221; she asked, stopping
him as he passed, &#8220;you air a-goin&#8217; to miss M&#8217;ri
turrible. You could never manige if it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
fer Penny. Won&#8217;t she hev the time of her life
cleanin&#8217; up after this weddin&#8217;? She&#8217;ll enjoy it
more&#8217;n she did gettin&#8217; ready fer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Penny won&#8217;t go to gittin&#8217; merried&ndash;&ndash;not
till Janey&#8217;s growed up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s a great help to you, too, Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave! I don&#8217;t know how I ever got along
afore he came. He&#8217;s so willin&#8217; and so honest.
He&#8217;s as good as gold. Only fault he&#8217;s got is a
quick temper. He&#8217;s doin&#8217; purty fair with it,
though. If only Jud&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, with a sigh, and Rhody hastened
to change the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a-lookin&#8217; spry to-night, Barnabas.
I hain&#8217;t seen you look so spruce in a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look mighty tasty yerself, Rhody.&#8221;</p>
<p>This interchange of compliments was interrupted
by the announcement of supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never set down to sech a repast,&#8221; thought
Miss Rhody. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t feed much to-day.
I don&#8217;t know whether to take chickin
twice, or to try all them meltin&#8217;, flaky lookin&#8217;
pies. And jest see them layer cakes!&#8221;</p>
<p>After supper adjournment was made to the
barn, where the fiddles were already swinging
madly. Every one caught the spirit, and even
Miss Rhody finally succumbed to Barnabas&#8217; insistence.
Pennyroyal captured Uncle Larimy,
and when Janey whirled away in the arms of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
schoolmate, David, who had never learned to
dance, stood isolated. He felt lonely and depressed,
and recalled the expression in which Joe
Forbes had explained life after he had acquired a
stepmother. &#8220;I was always on the edge of the
fireside,&#8221; he had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; expostulated Uncle Barnabas, as
soon as he could get his breath after the last
dance, &#8220;you&#8217;d better eddicate yer heels as well
as yer head. It&#8217;s unnateral fer a colt and a boy
not to kick up their heels. You don&#8217;t never want
to be a looker-on at nuthin&#8217; excep&#8217; from ch&#8217;ice.
You&#8217;d orter be a stand-in on everything that&#8217;s
a-goin&#8217; instead of a stand-by. The stand-bys
never git nowhar.&#8221;

<p class='tp' style='font-style:italic;font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-top:70px;'>PART TWO</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>David Dunne at eighteen was graduated
from the high school in Lafferton
after five colorless years in which study and farm
work alternated. Throughout this period he
had continued to incur the rancor of Jud, whose
youthful scrapes had gradually developed into
brawls and carousals. The Judge periodically
extricated him from serious entanglements, and
Barnabas continued optimistic in his expectations
of a time when Jud should &#8220;settle.&#8221; On one
occasion Jud sneeringly accused David of
&#8220;working the old man for a share in the farm,&#8221;
and taunted him with the fact that he was big
enough and strong enough to hustle for himself
without living on charity. David started on a
tramp through the woods to face the old issue
and decide his fate. He had then one more year
before he could finish school and carry out a
long-cherished dream of college.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>He was at a loss to know just where to turn
at the present time for a home where he could
work for his board and attend school. The
Judge and M&#8217;ri had gone abroad; Joe was on
his ranch; the farmers needed no additional help.</p>
<p>He had been walking swiftly in unison with
his thoughts, and when he came out of the woods
into the open he was only a mile downstream
from town. Upon the river bank stood Uncle
Larimy, skillfully swirling his line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanter try yer luck, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no luck just now, Uncle Larimy,&#8221; replied
the boy sadly.</p>
<p>Uncle Larimy shot him a quick, sidelong
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then move on, Dave, and chase arter it.
Thar&#8217;s allers luck somewhar. Jest like fishin&#8217;.
You can&#8217;t set in one spot and wait for luck tew
come to you like old Zeke Foss does. You must
keep a-castin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to cast, Uncle Larimy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Larimy pondered. He knew that Jud
was home, and he divined David&#8217;s trend of
thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stick to a plank allers, Dave, ef
you wanter amount tew anything. Strike out
bold, and swim without any life presarvers.
You might jest as well be a sleepy old cat in a
corner as to go smoothsailin&#8217; through life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that I have got to strike out, and at
once, Uncle Larimy, but I don&#8217;t just know where
to strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve all got to find
out fer ourselves. It&#8217;s a leap in the dark like,
and ef you don&#8217;t land nowhere, take another
leap, and keep a-goin&#8217; somewhar.&#8221;</p>
<p>David wended his way homeward, pondering
over Uncle Larimy&#8217;s philosophy. When he
went with Barnabas to do the milking that night
he broached the subject of leaving the farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how Jud feels about my being here,
Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say to you?&#8221; asked the old man
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I overheard a part of your conversation.
He is right. And if I stay here, he
will run away to sea. He told the fellows in
Lafferton he would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to stay, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t like to think you drove your son
away. If he gets into trouble, both you and I
will feel we are to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, I see why the Jedge hez got it all cut
out fer you to be a lawyer. You&#8217;ve got the
argyin&#8217; habit strong. But you can&#8217;t argue me
into what I see is wrong. This is the place fer
you to be, and Jud &#8217;ll hev to come outen his
spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me go away until he does. You
must give him every chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll you go?&#8221; asked Barnabas curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, yet,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll
think out a plan to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Jud, after all, who cut the Gordian
knot, and made one of his welcome disappearances,
which lasted until David was ready to
start in college. His savings, that he had accumulated
by field work in the summers and a
very successful poultry business for six years,
netted him four hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;One hundred dollars for each year,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
thought exultantly. &#8220;That will be ample with
the work I shall find to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he made known to his friends his long-cherished
scheme of working his way through
college. The Judge laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your four hundred dollars, David, will
barely get you through the first year. After
that, I shall gladly pay your expenses, for as
soon as you are admitted to the bar you are to
come into my office, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>David demurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall work my way through college,&#8221; he
said firmly.</p>
<p>He next told Barnabas of his intention and
the Judge&#8217;s offer which he had declined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you refused, Dave. You&#8217;ll only be
in his office till you&#8217;re ripe fer what I kin make
you. I&#8217;ve larnt that the law is a good foundation
as a sure steppin&#8217; stone tew it, so you kin hev
a taste of it. But the Jedge ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to pay
yer expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that he shall,&#8221; replied David.
&#8220;I want to pay my own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to send you tew college and send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
you right. No starvin&#8217; and garret plan fer you.
I&#8217;ve let Joe and the Jedge do fer you as much
as they&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to, but you&#8217;re mine from now
on. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do fer my own son if he cared
fer books, and you&#8217;re as near to me ez ef you
were my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much, Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, David,&#8221; he continued, unheeding the
interruption, &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll really be my son
some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of such exquisite happiness came into
the young eyes that Barnabas put out his hand
silently. In the firm hand-clasp they both
understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to let you help me through
college, though, Uncle Barnabas. It has always
been my dream to earn my own education.
When you pay for anything yourself, it seems
so much more your own than when it&#8217;s a gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him, Barnabas,&#8221; again counseled Uncle
Larimy. &#8220;Folks must feed diff&#8217;rent. Thar&#8217;s
the sweet-fed which must allers hev sugar, but
salt&#8217;s the savor for Dave. He&#8217;s the kind that
flourishes best in the shade.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Janey wrote to Joe of David&#8217;s plan, and there
promptly came a check for one thousand dollars,
which David as promptly returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>A few days before the time set for his departure
David set out on a round of farewell
visits to the country folk. It was one of
those cold, cheerless days that intervene between
the first haze of autumn and the golden glow of
October. He had never before realized how
lonely the shiver of wind through the poplars
could sound. Two innovations had been made
that day in the country. The rural delivery carrier,
in his little house on wheels, had made his
first delivery, and a track for the new electric-car
line was laid through the sheep meadow.
This inroad of progress upon the sanctity of
their seclusion seemed sacrilegious to David,
who longed to have lived in the olden time of
log houses, with their picturesque open fires and
candle lights. Following some vague inward
call, he went out of his way to ride past the tiny
house he had once called home, and which in all
his ramblings he had steadfastly avoided. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
had heard that the place had passed into the
hands of a widow with an only son, and that
they had purchased surrounding land for cultivation.
He had been glad to hear this, and had
liked to fancy the son caring for his mother as
he himself would have cared for his mother had
she lived.</p>
<p>As he neared the little nutshell of a house his
heart beat fast at the sight of a woman pinning
clothes to the line. Her fingers, stiff and swollen,
moved slowly. The same instinct that had
guided him down this road made him dismount
and tie his horse. The old woman came slowly
down the little path to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am David Dunne,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;and I
used to live here. I wanted to come to see my
old home once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought that the dim eyes gazing into his
were the saddest he had ever beheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, with the slow, German accent,
&#8220;I know of you. Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her into the little sitting room,
which was as barren of furnishings as it had
been in the olden days.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she invited.</p>
<p>He took a chair opposite a cheap picture of a
youth in uniform. A flag of coarse material
was pinned above this portrait, and underneath
was a roughly carved bracket on which was a
glass filled with goldenrod.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lived here with your mother,&#8221; she said
musingly, &#8220;and she was taken. I lived here
with my son, and&ndash;&ndash;he was taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said David. &#8220;I did not know&ndash;&ndash;was
he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes sought the picture on the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, answering his unspoken
question, as she lifted her eyes to her little
shrine, &#8220;he enlisted and went to the Philippines.
He died there of fever more than a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>David was silent. His brown, boyish hand
shaded his eyes. It had been his fault that he
had not heard of this old woman and the loss of
her son. He had shrunk from all knowledge
and mention of this little home and its inmates.
The country folk had recognized and respected
his reticence, which to people near the soil seems
natural. This had been the only issue in his life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
that he had dodged, and he was bitterly repenting
his negligence. In memory of his
mother, he should have helped the lonely old
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were left a poor, helpless boy,&#8221; she
continued, &#8220;and I am left a poor, helpless old
woman. The very young and the very old
meet in their helplessness, yet there is hope for
the one&ndash;&ndash;nothing for the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, memories,&#8221; he suggested softly, &#8220;and
the pride you feel in his having died as he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is that,&#8221; she acknowledged with a
sigh, &#8220;and if only I could live on here in this little
place where we have been so happy! But I
must leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked David quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;After my Carl died, things began to happen.
When once they do that, there is no stopping.
The bank at the Corners failed, and I
lost my savings. The turkeys wandered away,
the cow died, and now there&#8217;s the mortgage.
It&#8217;s due to-morrow, and then&ndash;&ndash;the man that
holds it will wait no longer. So it is the poorhouse,
which I have always dreaded.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>David&#8217;s head lifted, and his eyes shone radiantly
as he looked into the tired, hopeless
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mortgage will be paid to-morrow,
and&ndash;&ndash;Don&#8217;t you draw a pension for your son?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him in a dazed way.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there is no pension&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Thorne will get you one,&#8221; he said optimistically,
as he rose, ready for action, &#8220;and
how much is the mortgage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three hundred dollars,&#8221; she said despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost as much as the place is worth. Who
holds the mortgage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deacon Prickley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said David, trying to speak casually,
&#8220;I have three hundred dollars lying idle
for which I have no use. I&#8217;ll ride to town now
and have the Judge see that the place is clear to
you, and he will get you a pension, twelve dollars
a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worn, seamed face lifted to his was transfigured
by its look of beatitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; she implored. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
know about the pension. That will keep me, and
I can find another little place somewhere. But
the money you offer&ndash;&ndash;no! I have heard how
you have been saving to go through school.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas and the Judge are anxious
to pay my expenses at college, and&ndash;&ndash;you <i>must</i>
let me. I would like to think, don&#8217;t you see, that
you are living here in my old home. It will
seem to me as if I were doing it for <i>my</i> mother&ndash;&ndash;as
I would want some boy to do for her if she
were left&ndash;&ndash;and it&#8217;s my country&#8217;s service he died
in. I would rather buy this little place for you,
and know that you are living here, than to buy
anything else in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old face was quite beautiful now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will let you,&#8221; she said tremulously.
&#8220;You see, I am a hard-working woman and
quite strong, but folks won&#8217;t believe that, because
I am old; so they won&#8217;t hire me to do their
work, and they say I should go to the poorhouse.
But to old folks there&#8217;s nothing like
having your own things and your own ways.
They get to be a part of you. I was thinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
when you rode up that it would kill me not to
see the frost on the old poplar, and not to cover
up my geraniums on the chill nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something stirred in David&#8217;s heart like pain.
He stooped and kissed her gently. Then he
rode away, rejoicing that he had worked to this
end. Four hours later he rode back to the little
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Judge has paid over the money to Old
Skinflint Prickley,&#8221; he said blithely, &#8220;and the
place is all yours. The deacon had compounded
the interest, which is against the laws of the
state, so here are a few dollars to help tide you
over until the Judge gets the pension for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she said solemnly, &#8220;an old woman&#8217;s
prayers may help you, and some day, when you
are a great man, you will do great deeds, but
none of them will be as great as that which you
have done to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>David rode home with the echo of this benediction
in his ears. He had asked the Judge to
keep the transaction secret, but of course the
Judge told Barnabas, who in turn informed
Uncle Larimy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I told the boy when his ma died,&#8221; said Uncle
Larimy, &#8220;that things go &#8217;skew sometimes, but
that the sun would shine. The sun will allers be
a-shinin&#8217; fer him when he does such deeds as
this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>The fare to his college town, his books, and
his tuition so depleted David&#8217;s capital of
one hundred dollars that he hastened to deposit
the balance for an emergency. Then he set
about to earn his &#8220;keep,&#8221; as he had done in the
country, but there were many students bent on
a similar quest and he soon found that the demand
for labor was exceeded by the supply.</p>
<p>Before the end of the first week he was able to
write home that he had found a nice, quiet lodging
in exchange for the care of a furnace in
winter and the trimming of a lawn in other
seasons, and that he had secured a position as
waiter to pay for his meals; also that there was
miscellaneous employment to pay for his washing
and incidentals.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t go into details and explain that the
&#8220;nice quiet lodging&#8221; was a third-floor rear whose
gables gave David&#8217;s six feet of length but little
leeway. It was quiet because the third floor was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
not heated, and its occupants therefore stayed
away as much as possible. His services as
waiter were required only at dinner time, in exchange
for which he received that meal. His
breakfast and luncheon he procured as best he
could; sometimes he dispensed with them entirely.
Crackers, milk, and fruit, as the cheapest
articles of diet, appeared oftenest on his m&eacute;nu.
Sometimes he went fishing and surreptitiously
smuggled the cream of the catch up to his little
abode, for Mrs. Tupps&#8217; &#8220;rules to roomers,&#8221; as
affixed to the walls, were explicit: &#8220;No cooking
or washing allowed in rooms.&#8221; But Mrs. Tupps,
like her fires, was nearly always out, for she was
a member of the Woman&#8217;s Relief Corps, Ladies&#8217;
Aid, Ladies&#8217; Guild, Woman&#8217;s League, Suffragette
Society, Pioneer Society, and Eastern
Star. At the meetings of these various societies
she was constant in attendance, so in her absence
her roomers &#8220;made hay,&#8221; as David termed it,
cooking their provender and illicitly performing
laundry work in the bathtub. Still, there must
always be &#8220;on guard&#8221; duty, for Mrs. Tupps was
a stealthy stalker. One saw her not, but now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
and then there was a faint rustle on the stair.
David&#8217;s eyes and ears, trained to keenness, were
patient and vigilant, so he was generally chosen
as sentinel, and he acquired new caution, adroitness,
and a quietness of movement.</p>
<p>There had been three or four close calls.
Once, she had knocked at his door as he was
in the act of boiling eggs over the gas jet. In
the twinkling of an eye the saucepan was thrust
under the bed, and David, sweet and serene of
expression, opened the door to the inquisitive-eyed
Tupps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to borrow a pen,&#8221; she said shamelessly,
her eyes penetrating the cracks and crevices
of the little room.</p>
<p>David politely regretted that he used an indelible
pencil and possessed no pens.</p>
<p>In the act of removing all records and remains
of feasts, David became an adept. Neat,
unsuspicious looking parcels were made and conveyed,
after retiring hours, to a near-by vacant
lot, where once had been visible an excavation
for a cellar, but this had been filled to street level
with tin cans, paper bags, butter bowls, cracker
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
cases, egg shells, and pie plates from the House
of Tupps.</p>
<p>His miscellaneous employment, mentioned in
his letter, was any sort of work he could find
to do.</p>
<p>David became popular with professors by reason
of his record in classes and the application
and concentration he brought to his studies. His
prowess in all sports, his fairness, and the spirit
of <i>camaraderie</i> he always maintained with his
associates, made him a general favorite. He
wore fairly good clothes, was well groomed, and
always in good spirits, so of his privations and
poverty only one or two of those closest to him
were even suspicious. He was entirely reticent
on the subject, though open and free in all other
discourse, and permitted no encroachment on
personal matters. One or two chance offenders
intuitively perceived a slight but impassable
barrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunne has grown a little gaunt-eyed since
he first came here,&#8221; said one of his chosen friends
to a classmate one evening. &#8220;He&#8217;s outdoors
enough to counteract overstudy. But do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
suppose he has enough to eat? So many of
these fellows live on next to nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he were on rations.
You know he always makes some excuse
when we invite him to a spread. He&#8217;s too
proud to accept favors and not reciprocate, I
believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>David overheard these remarks, and a very
long walk was required to restore his serenity.
During this walk he planned to get some extra
work that would insure him compensation requisite
to provide a modest spread so that he
might allay their suspicions. Upon his return
to his lodgings he found an enormous box which
had come by express from Lafferton. It
contained Pennyroyal&#8217;s best culinary efforts;
also four dozen eggs, a two-pound pat of butter,
coffee, and a can of cream.</p>
<p>He propitiated Mrs. Tupps by the proffer
of a dozen of the eggs and told her of his desire
to entertain his friends. It would be impossible
to do this in his room, for when he lay
in bed he could touch every piece of furniture
with but little effort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>David had become his landlady&#8217;s confidant
and refuge in time of trouble, and she was willing
to allow him the privilege of the dining
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going away to-night for a couple of
days, but I would rather you wouldn&#8217;t mention
it to the others. You may have the use of the
dining room and the dishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s friends were surprised to receive an
off-hand invitation from him to &#8220;drop in for a
little country spread.&#8221; They were still more
surprised when they beheld the long table with
its sumptuous array of edibles,&ndash;&ndash;raised biscuits,
golden butter, cold chicken, pickles, jelly, sugared
doughnuts, pork cake, gold and silver
cake, crullers, mince pie, apple pie, cottage
cheese, cider, and coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a county fair exhibit, Dunne,&#8221;
said a city-bred chap.</p>
<p>Six healthy young appetites did justice to
this repast and insured David&#8217;s acceptance of
five invitations to dine. It took Mrs. Tupps
and David fully a week to consume the remnants
of this collation. The eggs he bestowed
upon an anemic-faced lodger who had been prescribed
a milk and egg diet, but with eggs at
fifty cents a dozen he had not filled his prescription.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>At the end of the college year David went
back to the farm, and a snug sense of comfort
and a home-longing filled him at the sight of
the old farmhouse, its lawn stretching into gardens,
its gardens into orchards, orchards
into meadows, and meadows into woodlands.
Through the long, hot summer he tilled the
fields, and invested the proceeds in clothes and
books for the ensuing year.</p>
<p>There followed three similar years of a hand-to-mouth
existence, the privations of which he
endured in silence. There were little occasional
oases, such as boxes from Pennyroyal, or extra
revenue now and then from tutoring, but there
were many, many days when his healthy young
appetite clamored in vain for appeasement. On
such days came the temptation to borrow from
Barnabas the money to finish his course in comfort,
but the young conqueror never yielded
to this enticement. He grew stronger and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
sturdier in spirit after each conflict, but lost
something from his young buoyancy and elasticity
which he could never regain. His struggles
added a touch of grimness to his old sense of
humor, but when he was admitted to the bar he
was a man in courage, strength, and endurance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>It seemed to David, when he was at the farm
again, that in his absence time had stood
still, except with Janey. She was a slender slip
of a girl, gentle voiced and soft hearted. Her
eyes were infinitely blue and lovely, and there
was a glad little ring in her voice when she
greeted &#8220;Davey.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri gave a cry of surprised pleasure when
she saw her former charge. He was tall, lithe,
supple, and hard-muscled. His face was not
very expressive in repose, but showed a quiet
strength when lighted by the keenness of his
serious, brown eyes and the sweetness of his
smile. His color was a deep-sea tan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so good to be alive, Aunt M&#8217;ri. I
thought I was weaned away from farm life until
I bit into one of those snow apples from the
old tree by the south corner of the orchard.
Then I knew I was home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pennyroyal shed her first visible tear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you are home again, David,&#8221; she
sniffed. &#8220;You were always such a clean boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed you more&#8217;n any one did, David,&#8221;
acknowledged Miss Rhody. &#8220;Ef I hed been
a Catholic I should a felt as ef the confessional
hed been took from me. I ain&#8217;t hed no one to
talk secret like to excep&#8217; when Joe comes onct
a year. He ain&#8217;t been fer a couple of years,
either, but he sent me anuther black dress the
other day&ndash;&ndash;silk, like the last one. To think of
little Joe Forbes a-growin&#8217; up and keepin&#8217; me
in silk dresses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy your next one for you,&#8221; declared
David emphatically.</p>
<p>The next day after his return from college
David started his legal labors under the watchful
eye of the Judge. He made a leap-frog
progress in acquiring an accurate knowledge of
legal lore. He worked and waited patiently
for the Judge&#8217;s recognition of his readiness
to try his first case, and at last the eventful
time came.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there isn&#8217;t the slightest prospect of his
winning it,&#8221; the Judge told his wife that night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The prosecution has strong evidence, and we
have nothing&ndash;&ndash;barely a witness of any account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the poor man will be convicted and
David will gain no glory,&#8221; lamented M&#8217;ri. &#8220;It
means so much to a young lawyer to win his
first case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither of them needs any sympathy.
Miggs ought to have been sent over the road long
ago. David&#8217;s got to have experience before he
gains glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to take such a case?&#8221;
asked M&#8217;ri, for the Judge was quite exclusive
in his acceptance of clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was David&#8217;s doings,&#8221; said the Judge, with
a frown that had a smile lurking behind it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he wish you to take the case?&#8221;
persisted M&#8217;ri.</p>
<p>&#8220;As near as I can make out,&#8221; replied the
Judge, with a slight softening of his grim
features, &#8220;it was because Miggs&#8217; wife takes in
washing when Miggs is celebrating.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri walked quickly to the window, murmuring
some unintelligible sound of endearment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>On the day of the summing-up at the trial
the court room was crowded. There were the
habitual court hangers on, David&#8217;s country
friends <i>en masse</i>, a large filling in at the back
of the representatives of the highways and
byways, associates of the popular wrongdoer,
and the legal lore of the town, with the good-humored
patronage usually bestowed by the
profession on the newcomer to their ranks.</p>
<p>As the Judge had said, his client was conceded
to be slated for conviction. If he had made the
argument himself he would have made it in his
usual cool, well-poised manner. But David, although
he knew Miggs to be a veteran of the
toughs, felt sure of his innocence in this case,
and he was determined to battle for him, not for
the sake of justice alone, but for the sake of
the tired-looking washerwoman he had seen
bending over the tubs. This was an occupation
she had to resort to only in her husband&#8217;s times
of indulgence, for he was a wage earner in his
days of soberness.</p>
<p>When David arose to speak it seemed to the
people assembled that the coil of evidence, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
reviewed by the prosecutor in his argument, was
drawn too closely for any power to extricate the
victim.</p>
<p>At the first words of the young lawyer,
uttered in a voice of winning mellowness, the
public forgot the facts in the case. Swayed by
the charm of David&#8217;s personality, a current of
new-born sympathy for the prisoner ran through
the court room.</p>
<p>David came up close to the jury and, as he
addressed them, he seemed to be oblivious of
the presence of any one else in the room. It
was as though he were telling them, his friends,
something he alone knew, and that he was sure
of their belief in his statements.</p>
<p>&#8220;For all the world,&#8221; thought M&#8217;ri, listening,
&#8220;as he used to tell stories when he was a
boy. He&#8217;d fairly make you believe they were
true.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure the jury were all his friends; they
had known him when he was little &#8220;barefoot
Dave Dunne.&#8221; Still, they were captivated by
this new oratory, warm, vivid, and inspiring,
delivered to the accompaniment of dulcet and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
seductive tones that transported them into an
enchanted world. Their senses were stirred in
the same way they would be if a flag were unfurled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds kind o&#8217; like orgin music,&#8221; whispered
Miss Rhody.</p>
<p>Yet underneath the eloquence was a logical
simplicity, a keen sifting of facts, the exposure
of flaws in the circumstantial evidence. There
was a force back of what he said like the force
back of the projectile. About the form of the
hardened sinner, Miggs, David drew a circle of
innocence that no one ventured to cross. Simply,
convincingly, and concisely he summed up,
with a forceful appeal to their intelligence, their
honor, and their justice.</p>
<p>The reply by the assistant to the prosecutor
was perfunctory and ineffective. The charge
of the judge was neutral. The jury left the
room, and were out eight and one-quarter minutes.
As they filed in, the foreman sent a triumphant
telepathic message to David before
he quietly drawled out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not guilty, yer Honor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>The first movement was from Mrs. Miggs.
And she came straight to David, not to the
jury.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; said the Judge, who had cleared his
throat desperately and wiped his glasses carefully,
at the look in the eyes of the young lawyer
when they had rested on the defendant&#8217;s
wife, &#8220;hereafter our office will be the refuge for
all the riffraff in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was his only comment, but the Judge did
not hesitate to turn over any case to him
thereafter.</p>
<p>When David had added a few more victories
to his first one, Jud made one of his periodical
diversions by an offense against the law which
was far more serious in nature than his previous
misdeeds had been. M&#8217;ri came out to the farm
to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barnabas, Martin thinks you had better let
the law take its course this time. He says it&#8217;s
the only procedure left untried to reform Jud.
He is sure he can get a light sentence for him&ndash;&ndash;two
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;ri,&#8221; said Barnabas, in a voice vibrating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
with reproach, &#8220;do you want Jud to go to
prison?&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri paled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do what is best for him, Barnabas.
Martin thinks it will be a salutary lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder, M&#8217;ri,&#8221; said Barnabas slowly, &#8220;if
the Judge had a son of his own, he would try
to reform him by putting him behind bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Barnabas!&#8221; protested M&#8217;ri, with a burst
of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still my boy, if he is wild, M&#8217;ri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Barnabas, Martin&#8217;s patience is exhausted.
He has got him out of trouble so
many times&ndash;&ndash;and, oh, Barnabas, he says he
won&#8217;t under any circumstances take the case!
He is ashamed to face the court and jury with
such a palpably guilty client. I have pleaded
with him, but I can&#8217;t influence him. You know
how set he can be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, there are other lawyers,&#8221; said Barnabas
grimly.</p>

&#8220;<i>He kept his word. Jud was cleared</i>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>David had remained silent and constrained
during this conversation, the lines of his young
face setting like steel. Suddenly he left the
house and paced up and down in the orchard, to
wrestle once more with the old problem of his
boyhood days. It was different now. Then it
had been a question of how much he must stand
from Jud for the sake of the benefits bestowed
by the offender&#8217;s father. Now it meant a sacrifice
of principle. He had made his boyish boast
that he would defend only those who were
wrongfully accused. To take this case would
be to bring his wagon down from the star.
Then suddenly he found himself disposed to
arraign himself for selfishly clinging to his
ideals.</p>
<p>He went back into the house, where M&#8217;ri was
still tearfully arguing and protesting. He
came up to Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will clear Jud, if you will trust the case to
me, Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas grasped his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, Dave, my boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
wanted you to, but Jud has been&ndash;&ndash;wal, I didn&#8217;t
like to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; said M&#8217;ri, when they were alone,
&#8220;Martin said you wouldn&#8217;t take a case where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
you were convinced of the guilt of the client.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall take this case,&#8221; was David&#8217;s quiet
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, David, Martin thinks it will be best
for Jud&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do what is best for Jud,
Aunt M&#8217;ri, I want to do what is best for Uncle
Barnabas. It&#8217;s the first chance I ever had to
do anything for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Judge Thorne found that David was
determined to defend Jud, he gave him some
advice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You must get counter evidence, if you can,
David. If you have any lingering idea that you
can appeal to the jury on account of Barnabas
being Jud&#8217;s father, root out that idea. There&#8217;s
no chance of rural juries tempering justice with
mercy. With them it&#8217;s an eye for an eye, every
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>David had an infinitely harder task in clearing
Jud than he had had in defending Miggs.
The evidence was clear, the witnesses sure
and wary, and the prisoner universally detested
save by his evil-minded companions, but these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
obstacles brought out in full force all David&#8217;s
indomitable will and alertness. He tipped up
and entrapped the prosecution&#8217;s witnesses with
lightning dexterity. One of them chanced to
be a man whom David had befriended, and he
aided him by replying shrewdly in Jud&#8217;s favor.</p>
<p>But it was Jud himself who proved to be
David&#8217;s trump card. He was keen, crafty, and
quick to seize his lawyer&#8217;s most subtle suggestions.
His memory was accurate, and with
David&#8217;s steering he avoided all traps set for
him on cross examination. When David stood
before the jury for the most stubborn fight he
had yet made, his mother&#8217;s last piece of advice&ndash;&ndash;all
she had to bequeath to him&ndash;&ndash;permeated
every effort. He put into his argument all the
compelling force within him. There were no
ornate sentences this time, but he concentrated
his powers of logic and persuasiveness upon his
task. The jury was out two hours, during
which time Barnabas and Jud sat side by side,
pale and anxious, but upheld by David&#8217;s confident
assurance of victory.</p>
<p>He kept his word. Jud was cleared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a smart lawyer, Dave,&#8221; commented
Uncle Larimy.</p>
<p>David looked at him whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a smart client, Uncle Larimy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you did, Dave, but he&#8217;s gettin&#8217;
too dernd smart. You&#8217;d a done some of us a
favor if you&#8217;d let him git sent up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; said Barnabas on one memorable
day, &#8220;the Jedge hez hed his innings trying
to make you a lawyer. Now it&#8217;s my turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Uncle Barnabas, I am ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t you hed enough of law, Dave?
You&#8217;ve given it a good trial, and showed what
you could do. It&#8217;ll be a big help to you to know
the law, and it&#8217;ll allers be sumthin&#8217; to fall back
on when things get slack, but ain&#8217;t you pinin&#8217;
fer somethin&#8217; a leetle spryer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; was the frank admission. &#8220;I
like the excitement attending a case, and the
fight to win, but it&#8217;s drudgery between times&ndash;&ndash;like
soldiering in time of peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, I&#8217;ve got a job fer you wuth
hevin&#8217;, and one that starts toward what you air
a-goin&#8217; to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s breath came quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s no reason at all why you can&#8217;t go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
legislatur&#8217; and make new laws instead of settin&#8217;
in the Jedge&#8217;s office and larnin&#8217; to dodge old ones.
I&#8217;m a-runnin&#8217; politics in these parts, and I&#8217;m
a-goin&#8217; to git you nominated. After that, you&#8217;ll
go the hull gamut&ndash;&ndash;so &#8217;t will be up the ladder
and over the wall fer you, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, David, to the astonishment of the Judge,
put his foot on the first round of the political
ladder as candidate for the legislature. At the
same time Janey returned from the school in
the East, where she had been &#8220;finished,&#8221; and
David&#8217;s heart beat an inspiring tattoo every
time he looked at her, but he was nominated by
a speech-loving, speech-demanding district, and
he had so many occasions for oratory that only
snatches of her companionship were possible
throughout the summer.</p>
<p>Joe came on to join in the excitement attending
the campaign. It had been some time
since his last visit, and he scarcely recognized
David when he met him at the Lafferton station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dave,&#8221; said the ranchman, &#8220;if you
are as strong and sure as you look, you won&#8217;t
need my help in the campaign.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I always need you, Joe. But you haven&#8217;t
changed in the least, unless you look more serious
than ever, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the outdoor life does that. Take a
field-bred lad, he always shies a bit at people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your horse does, too, I notice. He arrived
safely a week ago, and I put him up at the livery
here in Lafferton. I was afraid he would
demoralize all the horses at the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll ride out this evening. I have
a little business to attend to here in town, and
I want to see the Judge and his wife, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the western sky line gleamed in crimson
glory Joe came riding at a long lope up the
lane. He sat his spirited horse easily, one leg
thrown over the horn of his saddle. As he
neared the house, a thrashing machine started
up. The desert-bred horse shied, and performed
maneuvers terrifying to Janey, but Joe in the
saddle was ever a part of the horse. Quietly
and impassively he guided the frightened
animal until the machine was passed. Then he
slid from the horse and came up to Janey and
David, who were awaiting his coming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This can never be little Janey!&#8221; he exclaimed,
holding her hand reverently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t changed as much as Davey has,&#8221;
she replied, dimpling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you have! You are a woman.
David is still a boy, in spite of his six feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know about Davey!&#8221; she said
breathlessly. &#8220;He has won all kinds of law
cases, and he is going to the legislature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat, he is still a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the morrow David started forth on a
round of speech making, canvassing the entire
district. He returned at the wane of October&#8217;s
golden glow for the round-up, as Joe termed
the finish of the campaign. The flaunting crimson
of the maples, the more sedate tinge of
the oaks, the vivid yellow of the birches, the
squashes piled up on the farmhouse porches, and
the fields filled with pyramidal stacks of cornstalks
brought a vague sense of loneliness as he
rode out from Lafferton to the farm. He left
his horse at the barn and came up to the house
through the old orchard as the long, slanting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
rays of sunlight were making afternoon shadows
of all who crossed their path.</p>
<p>He found Janey sitting beneath their favorite
tree. An open book lay beside her. She
was gazing abstractedly into space, with a new
look in her star-like eyes.</p>
<p>David&#8217;s big, untouched heart gave a quick
leap. He took up the book and with an exultant
little laugh discovered that it was a book of
poems! Janey, who could never abide fairy
stories, reading poetry! Surprised and embarrassed,
after a shy greeting she hurried toward
the house, her cheeks flaming. Something very
beautiful and breath-taking came into David&#8217;s
thoughts at that moment.</p>
<p>He was roused from his beatific state by the
approach of Barnabas, so he was obliged to
concentrate his attention on giving a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
his tour. Then the Judge telephoned for him
to come to his office, and he was unable to finish
his business there until dusk. The night was
clear and frost touched. He left his horse in
the lane and walked up to the house. As he
came on to the porch he looked in through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
window. The bright fire on the hearth, the soft
glow of the shaded lamp, and the fair-haired
girl seated by a table, needlework in hand, gave
him a hunger for a hearth of his own.</p>
<p>Suddenly the scene shifted. Joe came in
from the next room. Janey rose to her feet, a
look of love lighting her face as she went to the
arms outstretched to receive her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>David went back to Lafferton. The little
maid informed him that the Judge and
his wife were out for the evening; but there was
always a room in readiness for him, so he sat
alone by the window, staring into the lighted
street, trying to comprehend that Janey was not
for him.</p>
<p>It was late the next morning when he came
downstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad, David, you decided to stay here
last night,&#8221; said M&#8217;ri, whose eyes were full of
a yearning solicitude.</p>
<p>She sat down at the table with him while he
drank his coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;David.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke in a desperate tone, that caused him
to glance keenly at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have anything to tell,&#8221; he said quietly,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a good plan to tell it at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you have been away Joe and Janey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
have been together constantly. It seems to
have been a case of mutual love. David, they
are engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;I am to lose my little
sister. Joe is a man in a thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, David, I had set my heart on Janey&#8217;s
marrying you, from that very first day when
you went to school together and you carried her
books. Do you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied whimsically, &#8220;but even then
Joe met us and took her away from me. But
I must drive out and congratulate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri gazed after him in perplexity as he left
the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;if I ever quite
understood David!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rhody called to David as he was passing
her house and bade him come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hed a hard trip,&#8221; she said, with a
keen glance into his tired, boyish eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very hard, Miss Rhody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard about Janey&ndash;&ndash;and Joe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt M&#8217;ri just told me,&#8221; he said, wincing
ever so slightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They was all sot on your being her sweetheart,
except me and her&ndash;&ndash;and Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not you, Miss Rhody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t never been in love with Janey&ndash;&ndash;not
the way you&#8217;ll love some day. When I
was sick last fall Almiry Green come over to
read to me and she brung a book of poems. I
never keered much for po&#8217;try, and Almiry, she
didn&#8217;t nuther, but she hed jest ketched Widower
Pankey, and so she thought it was proper
to be readin&#8217; po&#8217;try. She read somethin&#8217; about
fust love bein&#8217; a primrose, and a-fallin&#8217; to
make way fer the real rose, and I thought to
myself: &#8216;That&#8217;s David. His feelin&#8217; fer Janey
is jest a primrose.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s eyes were inscrutable, but she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed she hed allers fancied Joe sence
she was a little tot and he give her them beads.
When Joe&#8217;s name was spoke she was allers shy-like.
She wuz never shy-like with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted David wearily, &#8220;but I must
go on to the farm now, Miss Rhody. I will
come in again soon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>When he came into the sitting room of the
farmhouse, where he found Joe and Janey, the
rare smile that comes with the sweetness of
renunciation was on his lips. After he had congratulated
them, he asked for Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;He just started for the woods,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;I think he is on his way to Uncle Larimy&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>David hastened to overtake him, and soon
caught sight of the bent figure walking slowly
over the stubbled field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>Barnabas turned and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Janey and Joe?&#8221; he asked, looking
keenly into the shadowed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Aunt M&#8217;ri had told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning. Joe&#8217;s a man after your own
heart, Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you I wanted fer her,&#8221; said the old man
bluntly. &#8220;I never dreamt of its bein&#8217; enybody
else. It&#8217;s an orful disapp&#8217;intment to me,
Dave. I&#8217;d ruther see you her man than to see
you what I told you long ago I meant fer you
to be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I, too, Uncle Barnabas,&#8221; said David,
with slow earnestness, &#8220;would rather be your
son than to be governor of this state!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did care, then, David,&#8221; said the old
man sadly. &#8220;It don&#8217;t seem to be much of a
surprise to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas, I will tell you something
which I want no one else to know. I came back
last evening and drove out here. I looked in
the window, and saw her as she sat at work. It
came into my heart to go in then and ask her
to marry me, instead of waiting until after
election as I had planned. Then Joe came in
and she&ndash;&ndash;went to him. I returned to Lafferton.
It was daylight before I had it out with
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave! I thought I knew you better than
any of them. It&#8217;s been a purty hard test, but
you won&#8217;t let it spile your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t, Uncle Barnabas. I owe it to
you, if not to myself, to go straight ahead as
you have mapped it out for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, Dave! You&#8217;re the right stuff!&#8221;

<p class='tp' style='font-style:italic;font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-top:70px;'>PART THREE</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>In January David took his seat in the House
of Representatives, of which he was the
youngest member. It was not intended by that
august body that he should take any r&ocirc;le but
the one tacitly conceded to him of making
silver-tongued oratory on the days when the
public would crowd the galleries to hear an all-important
measure, the &#8220;Griggs Bill,&#8221; discussed.
The committee were to give him the facts and
the general line of argument, and he was to
dress it up in his fantastic way. They were
entirely willing that he should have the applause
from the public as well as the credit of the victory;
all they cared for was the certainty of the
passage of the bill.</p>
<p>David&#8217;s cool, lawyer-like mind saw through
all these manipulations and machinations even
if he were only a political tenderfoot. As other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
minor measures came up he voted for or against
them as his better judgment dictated, but all
his leisure hours were devoted to the investigation
and study of the one big bill which was to
be rushed through at the end of the session. He
pored over the status of the law, found out the
policies and opinions of other states on the subject,
and listened attentively to all arguments,
but he never took part in the discussions and he
was very guarded in giving an expression of
his views, an attitude which pleased the promoters
of the bill until it began to occur to them
that his caution came from penetration into
their designs and, perhaps, from intent to thwart
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has ketched on,&#8221; mournfully stated an
old-timer from the third district. &#8220;I&#8217;m allers
mistrustful of these young critters. They are
sure to balk on the home stretch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, one good thing,&#8221; grinned a city member,
&#8220;it breaks their record, and they don&#8217;t get
another entry.&#8221;</p>
<p>David had made a few short speeches on
some of the bills, and those who had read in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
papers of the wonderful powers of oratory of
the young member from the eleventh flocked
to hear him. They were disappointed. His
speeches were brief, forceful, and logical, but
entirely barren of rhetorical effect. The promoters
of the Griggs Bill began to wonder, but
concluded he was saving all his figures of speech
to sugarcoat their obnoxious measure. It occurred
to them, too, that if by chance he should
oppose them his bare-handed way of dealing
with subterfuges and his clear presentation of
facts would work harm. They counted, however,
on being able to convince him that his future
status in the life political depended upon his
co&ouml;peration with them in pushing this bill
through.</p>
<p>Finally he was approached, and then the
bomb was thrown. He quietly and emphatically
told them he should fight the bill, single
handed if necessary. Recriminations, arguments,
threats, and inducements&ndash;&ndash;all were of no
avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him hang himself if he wants to,&#8221;
growled one of the committee. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
influence enough to knock us out. We&#8217;ve got
the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The measure was one that would radically
affect the future interests of the state, and was
being watched and studied by the people, who
had not, as yet, however, realized its significance
or its far-reaching power. The intent of the
promoters of the Griggs Bill was to leave the
people unenlightened until it should have become
a law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunne won&#8217;t do us any harm,&#8221; argued the
father of the bill on the eventful day. &#8220;He&#8217;s
been saving all his skyrockets for this celebration.
He&#8217;ll get lots of applause from the
women folks,&#8221; looking up at the solidly packed
gallery, &#8220;and his speech will be copied in all the
papers, and that&#8217;ll be the reward he&#8217;s looking
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>When David arose to speak against the
Griggs Bill he didn&#8217;t look the youngster he had
been pictured. His tall, lithe, compelling figure
was drawn to its full height. His eyes
darkened to intensity with the gravity of the
task before him; the stern lines of his mouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
bespoke a master of the situation and compelled
confidence in his knowledge and ability.</p>
<p>The speech delivered in his masterful voice
was not so much in opposition to the bill as it
was an exposure of it. He bared it ruthlessly
and thoroughly, but he didn&#8217;t use his youthful
hypnotic periods of persuasive eloquence that
had been wont to sway juries and to creep into
campaign speeches. His wits had been sharpened
in the last few months, and his keen-edged
thrusts, hurled rapier-like, brought a wince to
even the most hardened of veteran members.
It was a complete enlightenment in plain words
to a plain people&ndash;&ndash;a concise and convincing
protest.</p>
<p>When he finished there was a tempest of arguments
from the other side, but there was not
a point he had not foreseen, and as attack only
brought out the iniquities of the measure, they
let the bill come to ballot. The measure was
defeated, and for days the papers were headlined
with David Dunne&#8217;s name, and accounts
of how the veterans had been routed by the
&#8220;tenderfoot from the eleventh.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>After his dip into political excitement legal
duties became a little irksome to David, especially
after the wedding of Joe and Janey had
taken place. In the fall occurred the death of
the United States senator from the western district
of the state. A special session of the legislature
was to be convened for the purpose of
pushing through an important measure, and the
election of a successor to fill the vacancy
would take place at the same time. The usual
&#8220;certain rich man,&#8221; anxious for a career, aspired,
and, as he was backed by the state machine
as well as by the covert influence of two
or three of the congressmen, his election seemed
assured.</p>
<p>There was an opposing candidate, the choice
of the people, however, who was gathering
strength daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to head off this man Dunne
some way,&#8221; said the manager of the &#8220;certain
rich man.&#8221; &#8220;He can&#8217;t beat us, but with him
out of the way it would be easy sailing, and all
opposition would come over to us on the second
ballot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a way to win him over?&#8221; asked
a congressman who was present.</p>
<p>The introducer of the memorable measure of
the last session shook his head negatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be persuaded, threatened, or
bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s get him out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kidnap him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Decoy him gently from your path. The
consul of a little seaport in South America has
resigned, and at a word from me to Senator
Hollis, who would pass it on to the President,
this appointment could be given to your young
bucker, and he&#8217;d be out of your way for at
least three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be too good to be true, but he
wouldn&#8217;t bite at such bait. His aspirations are
all in a state line. He&#8217;s got the usual career
mapped out,&ndash;&ndash;state senator, secretary of state,
governor&ndash;&ndash;possibly President.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can never tell,&#8221; replied the congressman
sagaciously. &#8220;A presidential appointment,
the alluring word &#8216;consul,&#8217; a foreign residence,
all sound very enticing and important to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
young country man. The Dunne type likes to
be the big frog in the puddle. This stripling
you are all so afraid of hasn&#8217;t cut all his wisdom
teeth yet. It&#8217;s worth a try. I&#8217;ll tackle him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning after this conversation, as
David walked down to the Judge&#8217;s office he felt
very lonely&ndash;&ndash;a part of no plan. It was a mood
that made him ripe for the purpose of the congressman
whom he found awaiting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to meet you for a long
time, Mr. Dunne,&#8221; said the congressman obsequiously,
after the Judge had introduced him.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard a great deal about you down in
Washington since your defeat of the Griggs
Bill, and we are looking for great things from
you. Of course, we have to keep our eye on
what is going on back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge looked his surprise at this speech,
and was still more mystified at receiving a knowing
wink from David.</p>
<p>After some preliminary talk the congressman
finally made known his errand, and tendered David
the offer of a consulship in South America.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Judge was summoned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the telephone in another room. When he returned
the congressman had taken his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold,&#8221; grinned David, &#8220;the future consul
of&ndash;&ndash;I really can&#8217;t pronounce it. I am going to
look it up now in your atlas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Gilbert?&#8221; asked the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to wire Hilliard before I can change
my mind. You see, it&#8217;s a scheme to get me out
of the road and I&ndash;&ndash;well I happen to be willing
to get out of the road just now. I am not in a
fighting mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Consular service,&#8221; remarked the Judge oracularly,
&#8220;is generally considered a sort of clearing
house for undesirable politicians. The
consuls to those little ports are, as a rule, very
poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a good consul like your junior partner
will loom up among so many poor ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas was inwardly disturbed by this
move from David, but he philosophically argued
that &#8220;the boy was young and &#8217;t wouldn&#8217;t
harm him to salt down awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; he counseled in farewell, &#8220;I hope
you&#8217;ll come to love some good gal. Every man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
orter hev a hearth of his own. This stretchin&#8217;
yer feet afore other folks&#8217; firesides is unnateral
and lonesome. Thar&#8217;s no place so snug and
safe fer a man as his own home, with a good wife
to keep it. But I want you tew make me a
promise, Dave. When I see the time&#8217;s ripe fer
pickin&#8217; in politics, will you come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, Uncle Barnabas,&#8221; promised David
solemnly.</p>
<p>The heartiest approval came from Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Dave, see all you can of the
world instead of settling down in a pasture lot
at Lafferton.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>Gilbert, complacent and affable, returned
to Washington accompanied by
David. A month later the newly made consul
sailed from New York for South America. He
landed at a South American seaport that had a
fine harbor snugly guarded by jutting cliffs
skirting the base of a hill barren and severe in
aspect.</p>
<p>As he walked down the narrow, foreign streets
thronged with a strange people, and saw the
structures with their meaningless signs, he began
to feel a wave of homesickness. Then, looking
up, he felt that little inner thrill that comes from
seeing one&#8217;s flag in a foreign land.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is why I am here,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;to
keep that flag flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>He resolutely started out on the first day to
keep the flag flying in the manner befitting the
kind of a consul he meant to be. He maintained
a strict watch over the commercial conditions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and his reports of consular news were promptly
rendered in concise and instructive form. His
native tact and inherent courtesy won him favor
with the government, his hospitality and kindly
intent conciliated the natives, and he was soon
also accorded social privileges. He began to enjoy
life. His duties were interesting, and his
leisure was devoted to the pursuit of novel
pleasures.</p>
<p>Fletcher Wilder, the son of the president of
an American mining company, was down there
ostensibly to look after his father&#8217;s interests, but
in reality to take out pleasure parties in his trim
little yacht, and David soon came to be the most
welcome guest that set foot on its deck.</p>
<p>At the end of a year, when his duties had become
a matter of routine and his life had lost
the charm of novelty, David&#8217;s ambitions started
from their slumbers, though not this time in a
political way. Wilder had cruised away, and
the young consul was conscious of a sense of
aloneness. He spent his evenings on his spacious
veranda, from where he could see the moonlight
making a rippling road of silver across the black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
water. The sensuous beauty of the tropical
nights brought him back to his early Land of
Dreams, and the pastime that he had been forced
to relinquish for action now appealed to him with
overwhelming force and fascination. But the
dreams were a man&#8217;s dreams, not the fleeting
fancies of a boy. They continued to possess and
absorb him until one night, when he was looking
above the mountains at one lone star that
shone brighter than the rest, he was moved
for the first time to give material shape and
form to his conceptions. The impulse led to
execution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get it out of my system,&#8221; he explained
half apologetically to himself as he began the
writing of a novel. To this task, as to everything
else he had undertaken, he brought the entire
concentration of his mind and energy, until
the book soon began to seem real to him&ndash;&ndash;more
real than anything he had done. As he was copying
the last page for the last time, Fletcher sailed
into the harbor for a week of farewell before
returning to New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you been doing for amusement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
these last six months, Dunne?&#8221; he asked as he
dropped into David&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d never guess,&#8221; said David, &#8220;what your
absence drove me to. I&#8217;ve written a book&ndash;&ndash;a
novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take it back to the hotel with me
to-night. I haven&#8217;t been sleeping well lately,
and it may&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it serves as a soporific,&#8221; said David gravely,
as he handed him the bulky package, &#8220;my labor
will not have been in vain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Wilder came again into
David&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear you didn&#8217;t sleep well, after all,&#8221; observed
David, looking at his visitor&#8217;s heavy-lidded
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darn you, Dunne. I took up your manuscript
and I never laid it down until the first
streaks of dawn. Then when I went to bed I
lay awake thinking it all over. Why, Dunne,
it&#8217;s the best book I ever read!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; David replied with a whimsical
smile, &#8220;that you were a publisher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of publishers, that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
bring the manuscript back. I sail in a week, and
I want you to let me take it to a publisher I
know in New York. He will give it a prompt
reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it wouldn&#8217;t bother you too much, I wish
you would. You see, it would take so long for
it to come back here and be sent out again each
time it is rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rejected!&#8221; scoffed Wilder. &#8220;You wait and
see! Aren&#8217;t you going to dedicate it?&#8221;</p>
<p>David hesitated, his eyes stealing dreamily out
across the bay to the horizon line.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said meditatively, &#8220;if the person
to whom it is dedicated&ndash;&ndash;every word of it&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&#8217;t
know without the inscription.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; objected Fletcher, &#8220;you should have it
appear out of compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as he wrote on a piece of paper:
&#8220;To T. L. P.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The initials of your sweetheart?&#8221; quizzed
Fletcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; when I was a little chap I used to spin
yarns. These are the initials of one who was my
most absorbed listener.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Wilder raised anchor and sailed back to the
states. At the expiration of two months he
wrote David that his book had been accepted.
In time ten bound copies of his novel, his allotment
from the publishers, brought him a thrill
of indescribable pleasure. The next mail brought
papers with glowing reviews and letters of commendation
and congratulations. Next came a
good-sized check, and the information that his
book was a &#8220;best seller.&#8221;</p>
<p>The night that this information was received
he went up to the top of the hill that jutted over
the harbor and listened to the song of the waves.
Two years in this land of liquid light&ndash;&ndash;a land of
burning days and silent, sapphired nights, a land
of palms and olives&ndash;&ndash;two years of quiet, dreamy
bliss, an idle and unsubstantial time! How
evanescent it seemed, by the light of the days at
home, when something had always pressed him
to action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years of drifting,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It is
time I, too, raised anchor and sailed home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next mail brought a letter that made his
heart beat faster than it had yet been able to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
in this exotic, lazy land. It was a recall from
Barnabas.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Dave</span>:</p>

<p>The letter brought to David&#8217;s eyes something
that no one in this balmy land had ever seen there.
With the look of a fighter belted for battle he
went to the telegraph office and cabled Barnabas,

<p>On his return to Lafferton David was met
at the train by the Judge, M&#8217;ri, and
Barnabas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your trunks air goin&#8217; out to the farm, Dave,
ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; asked Barnabas wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied David, with an emphasis
that brought a look of pleasure to the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your telegram took a great load offen my

&#8220;Miss Rhody told me all along I need hev no

<p>&#8220;Good for Miss Rhody!&#8221; laughed David.
&#8220;She shall have her reward. I brought her silk
enough for two dresses at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; said M&#8217;ri suddenly at the dinner
table, &#8220;do tell me for whose name those initials
in the dedication to your book stand. Is it any
one I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She figured largely in my fairy stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nickname he had for Janey,&#8221; she thought
with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas,&#8221; said David the next day,
&#8220;before we settle down to things political tell me
if you regret my South American experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;re back and gittin&#8217; into harness,
I&#8217;ll overlook anything. You&#8217;d earnt a
breathing spell, and you look a hull lot older.
Your book&#8217;s kep&#8217; your name in the papers, tew,
which helps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you something that proves the
book did more than that,&#8221; said David, drawing
his bank book from his pocket and passing it to
the old man, who read it unbelievingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dave, you&#8217;re rich!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not rich. I shall always have to work
for my living. So tell me the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fully occupied the time it took to drive
to town, for Cold Molasses, successor to Old
Hundred, kept the pace his name indicated.
The day was spent in meeting old friends, and
then David settled down to business with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
old-time energy. Once more he was nominated
for the legislature and took up the work of
campaigning for Stephen Hume, opponent to
Wilksley. Hume was an ardent, honest, clean-handed
politician without money, but he had
for manager one Ethan Knowles, a cool-headed,
tireless veteran of campaign battles, with David
acting as assistant and speech maker.</p>
<p>David was elected, went to the capital, and
was honored with the office of speaker by unanimous
vote. He had his plans carefully drawn
for the election of Hume, who came down on
the regular train and established headquarters
at one of the hotels, surrounded by a quiet and
determined body of men.</p>
<p>Wilksley&#8217;s supporters, a rollicking lot, had
come by special train and were quartered at a
club, dispensing champagne and greenbacks
promiscuously and freely. There was also
a third candidate, whose backers were non-committal,
giving no intimation as to where their
strength would go in case their candidate did
not come in as a dark horse.</p>
<p>When the night of the senatorial contest came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the floor, galleries, and lobby of the House were
crowded. The Judge, M&#8217;ri, and Joe were there,
Janey remaining home with her father, who
refused to join the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;ll be bigger doin&#8217;s fer me to see Dave
officiate at,&#8221; he prophesied.</p>
<p>The quietly humorous young man wielding
the gavel found it difficult to maintain quiet in
the midst of such excitement, but he finally
evolved order from chaos.</p>
<p>Wilksley was the first candidate nominated,
a gentleman from the fourteenth delivering a
bombastic oration in pompous periods, accompanied
by lofty gestures. He was followed by
an understudy, who made an ineffective effort
to support his predecessor.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ricochet shot,&#8221; commented Joe. &#8220;Wait
till Dave hits the bullseye.&#8221;</p>
<p>The supporting representatives of the dark
horse made short, forceful speeches. Then followed
a brief intermission, while David called
a substitute <i>pro tem</i> to the speaker&#8217;s desk. He
stepped to the platform to make the nominating
speech for Hume, the speech for which every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
one was waiting. There was a hush of expectancy,
and M&#8217;ri felt little shivers of excitement
creeping down her spine as she looked up at
David, dauntless, earnest, and compelling, as he
towered above them all.</p>
<p>In its simplicity, its ring of truth, and its
weight of conviction, his speech was a masterpiece.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young Patrick Henry!&#8221; murmured the
Judge.</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri made no comment, for in that flight of a
second that intervened between David&#8217;s speech
and the roar of tumultuous applause, she had
heard a voice, a young, exquisite voice, murmur
with a little indrawn breath, &#8220;Oh, David!&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri turned in surprise, and looked into the
confused but smiling face of a lovely young girl,
who said frankly and impulsively: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
who Mr. Hume may be, but I do hope he wins.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&#8217;ri smiled in sympathy, trying to place the
resemblance. Then her gaze wandered to the
man beside the young girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Carey Winthrop!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The man turned, and leaned forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thorne, this is indeed a pleasure,&#8221; he
said, extending his hand.</p>
<p>Joe then swung his chair around into their
vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Joe!&#8221; cried the young girl ecstatically.
&#8220;And where is Janey?&#8221;</p>
<p>The balloting was in progress, and there was
opportunity for mutual recalling of old times.
Then suddenly the sibilant sounds dropped to
silence as the result was announced. Wilksley
had the most votes, the dark horse the least;
Hume enjoyed a happy medium, with fifteen
more to his count than forecast by the man behind
the button, as Joe designated Knowles.</p>
<p>In the rush of action from the delegates, reporters,
clerks, and messengers, the place resembled
a beehive. Then came another ballot taking.
Hume had gained ten votes from the
Wilksley men and fifteen from the dark horse,
but still lacked the requisite number.</p>
<p>From the little retreat where Hume&#8217;s manager
was ensconced, with his hand on the throttle,
David emerged. He looked confident and
determined.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>The third ballot resulted in giving Hume the
entire added strength of the dark horse, and
enough votes to elect. A committee was thereupon
appointed to bring the three candidates to
the House. When they entered and were escorted
to the platform they each made a speech,
and then formed a reception line. David
stood apart, talking to one of the members.
He was beginning to feel the reaction from
the long strain he had been under and wished
to slip away from the crowd. Suddenly he
heard some one say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, may I congratulate you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>He turned quickly, his heart thrilling at the
charm in the voice, low, yet resonant, and
sweet with a lurking suggestion of sadness.</p>
<p>A girl, slender and delicately made, stood before
him, a girl with an exquisite grace and a
nameless charm&ndash;&ndash;the something that lurks in
the fragrance of the violet. Her eyes were not
the quiet, solemn eyes of the little princess of
his fairy tales, but the deep, fathomless eyes of
a maiden.</p>
<p>A reminiscent smile stole over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little princess!&#8221; he murmured, taking
her hand.</p>
<p>The words brought a flush of color to her fair
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prince is a politician now,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prince has to be a politician to fight
for his kingdom. Have you been here all the
evening?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; father and I sat with your party. But
you were altogether too absorbed to glance our
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you visiting in the city? Will you be
here long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For to-night only. I&#8217;ve been West with
father, and we only stopped off to see what a
senatorial fight was like; also, to hear you speak.
To-morrow we return East, and then mother
and I shall go abroad. Father,&#8221; calling to Mr.
Winthrop, &#8220;I am renewing my acquaintance
with Mr. Dunne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to do the same,&#8221; he said, extending
his hand cordially. &#8220;I expect to be able to tell
people some day that I used to fish in a country
stream with the governor of this state when
he was a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few moments of general conversation
they all left the statehouse together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey,&#8221; said Mr. Winthrop, &#8220;I am going
with the Judge to the club, so I will put you in
David&#8217;s hands. I believe you have no afraidments
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That has come to be a household phrase with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
us,&#8221; she laughed; &#8220;but you forget, father, that
Mr. Dunne has official duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you only knew,&#8221; David assured her
earnestly, &#8220;how thankful I am for a release
from them. My task is ended, and I don&#8217;t
wish to celebrate in the usual and political
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a big military ball at the hotel,&#8221; informed
Joe. &#8220;Mrs. Thorne and I thought we
would like to go and look on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine idea, Joe. Maybe you would like to
go?&#8221; he said to Carey, trying to make his tone
urgent.</p>
<p>She laughed at his dismayed expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you may walk to the Bradens&#8217; with me.
We couldn&#8217;t get in at the hotels, and father
met Major Braden on the street. He is instructor
or something of the militia of this state,
and has gone to the ball with his wife. They
supposed that this contest would last far into
the night, so they planned to be home before we
were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will get a carriage as soon as we are out
of the grounds.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come to carriages?&#8221; she asked,
laughingly. &#8220;You used to say if you couldn&#8217;t
ride horseback, or walk, you would stand
still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you agreed with me that carriages were
only for the slow, the stupid, and the infirm,&#8221;
he recalled. &#8220;It&#8217;s a glorious night. Would
you rather walk, really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the entrance to the grounds they parted
from the others and went up one of the many
avenues radiating from the square.</p>
<p>The air was full of snowflakes, moving so
softly and so slowly they scarcely seemed to
fall. The electric lights of the city shone
cheerfully through the white mist, and the sound
of distant mirthmakers fell pleasantly on the
ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow is the only picture part of winter,&#8221; said
Carey. &#8220;Do you remember the story of the
Snow Princess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have a wonderful memory!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;You were only six years old when
I told you that story.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have a very vivid memory,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Sometimes it almost frightens me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I think people
that have dreams and fancies do look backward
farther than matter-of-fact people, who let
things out of sight go out of mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were full of dreams then, but I don&#8217;t
believe you are now. Of course, politicians have
no time or inclination for dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they usually have a dread of dreams.
Would you rather have found me still a
dreamer?&#8221; he asked, looking down into her
dark eyes, which drooped beneath the intensity
of his gaze.</p>
<p>Then her delicate face, misty with sweetness,
turned toward him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; dreams are for children and for old people,
whose memories, like their eyes, are for
things far off. This is your time to do things,
not to dream them. And you have done things.
I heard Major Braden telling father about you
at dinner&ndash;&ndash;your success in law, your getting some
bill killed in the legislature, and your having
been to South America. Father says you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
had a wonderful career for a young man. I
used to think when I was a little girl that when
you were a grown-up prince you would kill dragons
and bring home golden fleeces.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled with a sudden deep throb of pleasure.
Her voice stirred him with a sense of
magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Braden home,&#8221; she said, stopping
before a big house that seemed to be all pillars
and porches. &#8220;You&#8217;ll come in for a little
while, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come in, if I may, and help you to recall
some more of Maplewood days.&#8221;</p>
<p>A trim little maid opened the door and led
the way into a long library where in the fireplace
a pine backlog, crisscrossed by sturdy forelogs of
birch and maple, awaited the touch of a match.
It was given, and the room was filled with a
flaring light that made the soft lamplight seem
pale and feeble.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a genuine Brumble fire,&#8221; he exclaimed,
as they sat down before the ruddy
glow. &#8220;It carries me back to farm life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many phases of life you have seen,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
mused Carey. &#8220;Country, college, city, tropical,
and now this political life. Which one have you
really enjoyed the most?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My life in the Land of Dreams&ndash;&ndash;that beautiful
Isle of Everywhere,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>Her eyes grew radiant with understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not so very much changed since your
days of dreaming,&#8221; she said, smiling. &#8220;To be
sure, you have lost your freckles and you don&#8217;t
kick at the ground when you walk, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he reminded, as she paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are no longer twice my age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Janey tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the last summer I was at Maplewood&ndash;&ndash;the
summer you were graduated. You say
you don&#8217;t dream any more, but it wasn&#8217;t so very
long ago that you did, else how could you have
written that wonderful book?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you read it?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could any one begin it and not finish it?
I&#8217;ve read some parts of it many times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you,&#8221; he asked slowly, holding her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
in spite of her desire to lower them, &#8220;read the
dedication?&#8221;</p>
<p>And by their subtle confession he knew that
this was one of the parts she had read &#8220;many
times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, trying to speak lightly, but
breathing quickly, &#8220;and I wondered who T. L.
P. might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; in slow, disappointed
tones, &#8220;that they stood for the name I
gave you when I first met you&ndash;&ndash;the name by
which I always think of you? It was with
your perfect understanding of my old fancies
in mind that I wrote the book. And so I dedicated
it to you, thinking if you read it you would
know even without the inscription. Some one
suggested&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Fletcher,&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know Wilder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve known him always. He has told
me of your days in South America together and
how he told you to dedicate it. And he wondered
who T. L. P. might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never guessed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Her face, bent over the firelight, looked small
and white; her beautiful eyes were fixed and
grave. Then suddenly she lifted them to his with
the artlessness of a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did know,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;At least, I
hoped&ndash;&ndash;I claimed it as my book, anyway,
but I thought your memory of those summers
at the farm might not have been as keen as
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is keen,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have always
thought of you as a little princess who only lived
in my dreams, but, hereafter, you are not only
in my past dreams, but I hope, in my future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we come back&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be gone long?&#8221; he asked wistfully.
&#8220;Is your father&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father can&#8217;t go, but he may join us.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s hesitation she continued,
with a slight blush:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fletcher is going with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, wondering at his tinge of disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey,&#8221; he said wistfully, as he was leaving,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think when a man dedicates a book
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to a girl, and they both have a joint claim on a
territory known as the Land of Dreams, that
she might call him, as she did when they were
boy and girl, by his first name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, David,&#8221; she replied with a light little
laugh.</p>
<p>The music of the soft &#8220;a&#8221; rang entrancingly
in his ears as he walked back to the hotel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>There was but one important measure to
deal with in this session of the legislature,
but David&#8217;s penetration into a thorough understanding
of each bill, and the patience and sagacity
he displayed in settling all disputes, won the
approbation of even doubtful and divided factions.
He flashed a new fire of life into the ebbing
enthusiasm of his followers, whom he had led
to victory on the Griggs Bill. At the close of the
session, early in May, he was presented with a
set of embossed resolutions commending his fulfillment
of his duties.</p>
<p>That same night, in his room at the hotel, as
he was packing his belongings, he was waited
upon by a delegation composed alike of horny-handed
tillers of the soil and distinguished statesmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come, David,&#8221; said the spokesman, who
had been chairman of the county convention,
&#8220;to say that you are our choice for the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
governor of this state, and in saying this we
know we are echoing the sentiment of the Republican
party. In fact, we are looking to you
as the only man who can bring that party to
victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said many more things, flattering and
echoed by his followers. It made the blood tingle
in David&#8217;s veins to know that these men of
plain, honest, country stock, like himself, believed
in him and in his honor. In kaleidoscopic
quickness there passed in review his life,&ndash;&ndash;the
days when he and his mother had struggled with
a wretched poverty that the neighbors had only
half suspected, the first turning point in his life,
when he was taken unto the hearth and home of
strong-hearted people, his years at college, the
plodding days in pursuit of the law, his hotly
waged fight in the legislature, and his short literary
career, and he felt a surging of boyish
pride at the knowledge that he was now approaching
his goal.</p>
<p>The next morning David went to Lafferton in
order to discuss the road to the ruling of the
people.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whom would you suggest for manager of
my campaign, Uncle Barnabas?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowles came to me and offered his services.
Couldn&#8217;t have a slicker man, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None better in the state. I shouldn&#8217;t have
ventured to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janey was home for the summer, and on the
first evening of his return she and David sat together
on the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Davey,&#8221; she said with a little sob, &#8220;Jud
has come home again, and they say he isn&#8217;t
just wild any more, but thoroughly bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears in her eyes and the tremor in her
tone stirred all his old protective instinct for
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Jud! I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t awaken some
ambition in him for a different life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been very patient, Davey, but do try
again. Every one is down on him now but
father and you and me. Aunt M&#8217;ri has let the
Judge prejudice her; Joe hasn&#8217;t a particle of
patience with him, and he can&#8217;t understand how
I can have any, but you do, Davey. You understand
everything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>They sat in silence, watching the stars pierce
vividly through the blackness of the sky, and
presently his thoughts strayed from Jud and
from his fair young sister. In fancy he saw the
queenly carriage of an imperious little head, the
mystery lurking in a pair of purple eyes, and
heard the cadence in an exquisite voice.</p>
<p>The next morning he began the fight, and there
was an incessant cannonade from start to finish
against the upstart boy nominee, who proved
to be an adversary of unremitting activity, the
tact and experience of Knowles making a fortified
intrenchment for him. All of David&#8217;s
friends rallied strongly to his support. Hume
came from Washington, Joe from the ranch, and
Wilder from the East, his father having a branch
concern in the state.</p>
<p>Through the long, hot summer the warfare
waged, and by mid-autumn it seemed a neck and
neck contest&ndash;&ndash;a contest so susceptible that the
merest breath might turn the tide at any moment.
The week before the election found David
still resolute, grim, and determined. Instead
of being discouraged by adverse attacks he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
gained new vigor from each downthrow. All
forces rendezvoused at the largest city in the
state for the final engagement.</p>
<p>Three days before election he received a note
in a handwriting that had become familiar to
him during the past year. With a rush of surprise
and pleasure he noted the city postmark.
The note was very brief, merely mentioning the
hotel at which they were stopping and asking
him to call if he could spare a few moments from
his campaign work.</p>
<p>In an incredibly short time after the receipt
of this note he was at the hotel, awaiting an answer
to his card. He was shown to the sitting
room of the suite, and Carey opened the door
to admit him. This was not the little princess
of his dreams, nor the charming young girl who
had talked so ingenuously with him before the
Braden fireside. This was a woman, stately yet
gracious, vigorous yet exquisite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad we came home in time to see you
elected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is a great honor, David,
to be the governor of your state.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a shade of deference in her manner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
to him which he realized was due to the awe with
which she regarded the dignity of his elective office.
This amused while it appealed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on our way to California to spend
the winter,&#8221; she replied, in answer to his eager
question, &#8220;and father proposed stopping here
until after election.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You come in and out of my life like a comet,&#8221;
he complained wistfully.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winthrop came in, smiling and charming
as ever. She was very cordial to David, and
interested in his campaign, but it seemed to
him that she was a little too gracious, as if
she wished to impress him with the fact that it
was a concession to meet him on an equal social
footing. For Mrs. Winthrop was inclined to be
of the world, worldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have arrived at an auspicious time,&#8221; he
assured her. &#8220;To-night the Democrats will have
the biggest parade ever scheduled for this city.
Joe calls it the round-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is Joe here?&#8221; asked Carey eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and another friend of yours, Fletcher
Wilder.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that he was here,&#8221; she said, with an
odd little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had expected to see him in New York,
and were surprised to learn he was out here,&#8221;
said Mrs. Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came to help me in my campaign,&#8221; informed
David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fletcher interested in politics! How
strange!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His interest is purely personal. We were
together in South America, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad that you have a friend in him,&#8221;
said Mrs. Winthrop affably. &#8220;The parade will
pass here, and Fletcher is coming up, of course.
Why not come up, too, if you can spare the
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not my night,&#8221; laughed David. &#8220;It&#8217;s
purely and simply a Democratic night. I shall
be pleased to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring Joe, too,&#8221; reminded Carey.</p>
<p>When Mr. Winthrop came in David had no
doubt as to the welcome he received from the
head of the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s measure of a man,&#8221; thought David,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
&#8220;is easily taken, and by natural laws, but oh, for
an understanding of the scales by which women
weigh! And yet it is they who hold the balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fletcher and David and Joe are coming to-night
to watch the parade from here,&#8221; said
Carey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall all dine with us,&#8221; said Mr. Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied David, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must,&#8221; insisted Mrs. Winthrop,
who always warmly seconded any proffer of hospitality
made by her husband. &#8220;Fletcher will
dine with us, of course. We can have a little
dinner served here in our rooms. Write a note
to Mr. Forbes, Carey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marked difference in type of her three
guests as they entered the sitting room that night
struck Mrs. Winthrop forcibly. Joe, lean and
brown, with laughing eyes, was the typical frontiersman;
Fletcher, quiet and substantial looking,
with his air of culture and ease and his modulated
voice, was the type of a city man; David&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;What
a man he is!&#8221; she was forced to admit as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
he stood, head uplifted in the white glare under
the chandelier, the brilliant light shining upon
his dark hair, and his eyes glowing like stars. His
lithe figure, perfect in poise and balance, of virile
strength that was toil-proof, wore the look of
the outdoor life. His smile banished everything
that was ordinary from his face and transmuted
it into a glowing personality. His eyes, serious
with that insight of the observer who knows
what is going on without and within, were clear
and steady.</p>
<p>The table was laid for six in the sitting room,
the flowers and candles giving it a homelike
look.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Winthrop listened to the conversation
between her husband and David she was forced
to admit that the young candidate for governor
was a man of mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew a man without good birth to
have such perfect breeding,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;He
really appears as well as Fletcher, and, well, of
course, he has more temperament. If he could
have been born on a different plane,&#8221; thinking
of her long line of Virginia ancestors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>She had ceded a great deal to her husband&#8217;s
and Carey&#8217;s democracy, and reserved many an
unfavorable criticism of their friends and their
friends&#8217; ways with a tactfulness that had blinded
their eyes to her true feelings. Yet David knew
instinctively her standpoint; she partly suspected
that he knew, and the knowledge did not disturb
her; she intuitively gauged his pride, and welcomed
it, for a suitor of the Fletcher Wilder station
of life was more to her liking.</p>
<p>Carey led David away from her father&#8217;s political
discourse, and encouraged him to give
reminiscences of old days. Joe told a few inimitable
western stories, and before the cozy little
meal was finished Mrs. Winthrop, though
against her will, was feeling the compelling force
of David&#8217;s winning sweetness. The sound of a
distant band hurried them from the table to the
balcony.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve certainly got a fair showing of floating
banners and transformations,&#8221; said Joe.</p>
<p>As the procession came nearer the face of the
hardy ranchman flushed crimson and his eyes
flashed dangerously. He made a quick motion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
as if to obstruct David&#8217;s vision, but the young
candidate had already seen. He stood as if at
bay, his face pale, his eyes riveted on those floating
banners which bore in flaming letters the inscriptions:</p>
<p>&#8220;The father of David Dunne died in state
prison!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother was a washerwoman!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>The others were stricken into shocked silence
which they were too stunned for the
moment to break. It was Fletcher who recovered
first, but then Fletcher was the only one
present who did not know that the words had
struck home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t wait another moment, David,&#8221;
he said emphatically, &#8220;to get out sweeping denials
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t,&#8221; said David wearily. &#8220;It is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; responded Fletcher lamely.</p>
<p>There was another silence. Something in
David&#8217;s voice and manner had made the silence
still more constrained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down and smash their banners!&#8221; muttered
Joe, who had not dared to look in David&#8217;s
direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop restrained him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter will take care of itself,&#8221; he counseled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>It is mercifully granted that the intensity of
present suffering is not realized. Only in looking
back comes the pang, and the wonder at the
seemingly passive endurance.</p>
<p>Again David&#8217;s memory was bridging the past
to unveil that vivid picture of the patient-eyed
woman bending over the tub, and the pity for her
was hurting him more than the cruel banner which
was flaunting the fact before a jeering, applauding
crowd.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winthrop gave him a covert glance. She
had great pride in her lineage, and her well-laid
plans for her daughter&#8217;s future did not include
David Dunne in their scope, but she was ever
responsive to distress.</p>
<p>Before the look in his eyes every sensation
save that of sympathy left her, and she went to
him as she would have gone to a child of her own
that had been hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she said tenderly, laying her hand on
his arm, &#8220;any woman in the world might be glad
to take in washing to bring up a boy to be such
a man as you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Deeply moved and surprised, he looked into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
her brimming eyes and met there the look he had
sometimes seen in the eyes of his mother, of M&#8217;ri,
and once in the eyes of Janey. Moved by an
irresistible impulse, he stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p>The situation was relieved of its tenseness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Joe,&#8221; said David, speaking collectedly,
&#8220;we had better go to headquarters.
Knowles will be looking for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented Joe, eager to get into action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey,&#8221; said David in a low voice, as he was
leaving.</p>
<p>As she turned to him, an impetuous rush of
new life leaped torrent-like in his heart. Her
eyes met his slowly, and for a moment he felt
a pleasure acute with the exquisiteness of pain.
Such sensations are usually transient, and in another
moment he had himself well in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say good night,&#8221; he said quietly,
&#8220;and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come here to-morrow at eleven?&#8221;
she asked hurriedly. &#8220;There is something I want
to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that you are sorry for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what I mean to say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>A wistful but imperious message was flashed
to him from her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; he replied gravely.</p>
<p>When he reached headquarters he found
the committee dismayed and distracted. Like
Wilder, they counseled a sweeping denial, but
David was firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; he reiterated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will cost us the vote of a certain element,&#8221;
predicted the chairman, &#8220;and we haven&#8217;t one to
spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>David listened to a series of similar sentiments
until Knowles&ndash;&ndash;a new Knowles&ndash;&ndash;came in. The
usual blank placidity of his face was rippled by
radiant exultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;before that parade
started to-night I had made out another conservative
estimate, and thought I could pull you
through by a slight majority. Now, it&#8217;s different.
While you may lose some votes from the
&#8216;near-silk stocking&#8217; class, yet for every vote so
lost hundreds will rally to you. That all men
are created equal is still a truth held to be
self-evident. The spark of the spirit that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
prompted the Declaration of Independence is
always ready to be fanned to a flame, and the
Democrats have furnished us the fans in their
flying pennants.&#8221;</p>
<p>David found no balm in this argument. All
the wounds in his heart were aching, and he could
not bring his thoughts to majorities. He passed
a night of nerve-racking strain. The jeopardy
of election did not concern him. That night at
the dinner party he had realized that he had a
formidable rival in Fletcher, who had a place
firmly fixed in the Winthrop household. Still,
against odds, he had determined to woo and win
Carey.</p>
<p>He had thought to tell her of his father&#8217;s
imprisonment under softening influences. To
have it flashed ruthlessly upon her in such a way,
and at such a time, made him shrink from asking
her to link her fate with his, and he decided to
put her resolutely out of his life.</p>
<p>Unwillingly, he went to keep his appointment
with her the next morning. He also dreaded an
encounter with Mrs. Winthrop. He felt that
the reaction from her moment of womanly pity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
would strand her still farther on the rocks of her
worldliness. He was detained on his way to the
hotel so that it was nearly twelve when he arrived.
It was a relief to find Carey alone. There
was an appealing look in her eyes; but David felt
that he could bear no expression of sympathy,
and he trusted she would obey the subtle message
flashed from his own.</p>
<p>With keen insight she read his unspoken appeal,
but a high courage dwelt in the spirit of
the little Puritan of colonial ancestry, and she
summoned its full strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;did you think I was ignorant
of your early life until I read those banners
last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; he said, flushing and taken by
surprise, &#8220;that you might have long ago heard
something, but to have it recalled in so sensational
a way when you were entertaining me at
dinner&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;David, the first day I met you, when I was
six years old, Mrs. Randall told us of your father.
I didn&#8217;t know just what a prison was, but I supposed
it something very grand, and it widened
the halo of romance that my childish eyes had
cast about you. The morning after you had nominated
Mr. Hume I saw your aunt at the hotel,
and she told me, for she said some day I might
hear it from strangers and not understand.
When I saw those banners it was not so much
sympathy for you that distressed me; I was thinking
of your mother, and regretting that she could
not be alive to hear you speak, and see what her
bravery had done for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>David had to summon all his control and his
recollection of her Virginia ancestors to refrain
from telling her what was in his heart. Mrs.
Winthrop helped him by her entrance at this crucial
point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, David,&#8221; she said suavely.
&#8220;Carey, Fletcher is waiting for you at the elevator.
Your father stopped him. I told him
you would be out directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an engagement to drive with him,&#8221; explained
Carey. &#8220;I thought you would come
earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am due at a committee meeting,&#8221; he said, in
a courteous but aloof manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We start in the morning, you know,&#8221; she
reminded him. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you dine here with us
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he refused. &#8220;It will be impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur is going to a club for luncheon,&#8221; said
Mrs. Winthrop, when Carey had gone into the
adjoining room, &#8220;and I shall be alone unless you
will take pity on my loneliness. I won&#8217;t detain
you a moment after luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he replied abstractedly.</p>
<p>She smiled at the reluctance in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;David is going to stay to luncheon with me,&#8221;
she announced to Carey as she came into the sitting
room.</p>
<p>David winced at the huge bunch of violets
fastened to her muff. He remembered with a
pang that Fletcher had left him that morning
to go to a florist&#8217;s. After she had gone Mrs.
Winthrop turned suddenly toward him, as he
was gazing wistfully at the closed door.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she asked directly, &#8220;why did you refuse
our invitation to dine to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;you see&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Winthrop&ndash;&ndash;with so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
many engagements&ndash;&ndash;there is a factory meeting
at five&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David, you are floundering! That is not like
the frankly spoken boy we used to know at Maplewood.
I kept you to luncheon to tell you
some news that even Carey doesn&#8217;t know yet.
Mrs. Randall has written insisting that we spend
a week at Maplewood before we go West. As
we are in no special haste, I shall accept her hospitality.&#8221;</p>
<p>David made no reply, and she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going home the day before election?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Winthrop,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go down with you, and I hope you
will be neighborly while we are in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bewildered look in his eyes deepened, and
then a heartrending solution of her graciousness
came to him. Fletcher and Carey were doubtless
engaged, and this fact made Mrs. Winthrop
feel secure in extending hospitality to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Winthrop,&#8221; he said, a little
bitterly. &#8220;You are very kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she asked, giving him a searching
look. &#8220;What is the matter? I thought you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
would be pleased at the thought of our spending
a week among you all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a quick, desperate decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Winthrop,&#8221; he asked earnestly, &#8220;may I
speak to you quite openly and honestly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David Dunne, you couldn&#8217;t speak any other
way,&#8221; she asserted, with a gay little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Carey!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>This information seemingly conveyed no
startling intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Mrs. Winthrop, evidently
awaiting a further statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t tried to win her love, nor have I
told her that I love her, because I knew that in
your plans for her future you had never included
me. I know what you think about family, and I
don&#8217;t want to make ill return for the courtesy
and kindness you and Mr. Winthrop have always
shown me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David, you have one rare trait&ndash;&ndash;gratitude. I
did have plans for Carey&ndash;&ndash;plans built on the basis
of &#8216;family&#8217;; but I have learned from you that
there are other things, like the trait I mentioned,
for instance, that count more than lineage. Before
we went abroad I knew Carey was interested
in you, with the first flutter of a young girl&#8217;s
fancy, and I was secretly antagonistic to that
feeling. But last night, David, I came to feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
differently. I envied your mother when I read
those banners. If I had a son like you, I&#8217;d feel
honored to take in washing or anything else for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the look of ineffable sadness in his eyes her
tears came.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she said gently, after a pause, &#8220;if
you can win Carey&#8217;s love, I shall gladly give my
consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thanked her incoherently, and was seized
with an uncontrollable longing to get away&ndash;&ndash;to
be alone with this great, unbelievable happiness.
In realization of his mood, she left him under
pretext of ordering the luncheon. On her
return she found him exuberant, in a flow of
spirits and pleasantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Winthrop,&#8221; he said earnestly, as he was
taking his departure, &#8220;I am not going to tell
Carey just yet that I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish, David. I shall not mention our
conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled as the door closed upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her! I wonder if he doesn&#8217;t know that
every time he looks at her, or speaks her name,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
he tells her. But I suppose he has some foolish
mannish pride about waiting until he is
governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>When David, in a voice vibrant with new-found
gladness, finished an eloquent address to
a United Band of Workmen, he found Mr. Winthrop
waiting for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sent to bring you to the hotel to dine
with us, David. My wife told me of your conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting the look of apprehension in David&#8217;s
eyes, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time a suitor for Carey has crossed our
threshold I&#8217;ve turned cold at the thought of relinquishing
my guardianship. With you it is different;
I can only quote Carey&#8217;s childish remark&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;with
David I would have no afraidments.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A touch upon his shoulder prevented David&#8217;s
reply. He turned to find Joe and Fletcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowles has been looking for you everywhere.
He wants you to come to headquarters
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it important?&#8221; asked David hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Important! Knowles! Say, David, have you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
forgotten that you are running for governor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Winthrop laughed appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to Knowles, David, and come to us
when you can. We have no iron-clad rules as to
hours. Go with him, Joe, to be sure he doesn&#8217;t
forget where he is going. Come with me,
Fletcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to call now,&#8221; remonstrated Joe,
when David had finally made his escape from
headquarters.</p>
<p>David muttered that time was made for slaves,
and increased his pace. When they reached the
hotel Joe refused to go to the Winthrop&#8217;s apartment.</p>
<p>David found Carey alone in the sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she asked, after one glance into his
eyes, &#8220;what has changed you? Good news from
Mr. Knowles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Carey,&#8221; he replied, his eyes growing luminous.
&#8220;It was something your mother said to
me this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad. What was it she said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me,&#8221; he evaded, &#8220;that you were going
to visit the Randalls.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what makes you look so&ndash;&ndash;cheered?&#8221;
she persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Carey. May I tell you at two o&#8217;clock in
the afternoon, the day after election?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like our childhood days. You
used to put notes in the old apple tree&ndash;&ndash;do you
remember?&ndash;&ndash;asking Janey and me to meet you
two hours before sundown at the end of the picket
fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further confidential conversation was prevented
by the entrance of the others. Joe had
been captured, and Mrs. Winthrop had ordered
a supper served in the rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey,&#8221; asked her mother softly, when they
were alone that night, &#8220;did David tell you what
a cozy little luncheon we had?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me, mother, that you said something
to him that made him very happy, but he would
not tell me what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her mother&#8217;s gaze made Carey
lift her violets as a shield to her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows!&#8221; thought Mrs. Winthrop. &#8220;But
does she care?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>At two o&#8217;clock on the day after David Dunne
had been elected governor by an overwhelming
majority, he reined up at the open gate at the
end of the maple drive. His heart beat faster at
the sight of the regal little figure awaiting him.
Her coat, furs, and hat were all of white.</p>
<p>He helped her into the carriage and seated himself
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been waiting long, and are you
dressed quite warmly?&#8221; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; I thought you might keep me
waiting at the gate, so I put on my furs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drive went on through the grounds to a
sloping pasture, where it became a rough roadway.
The day was perfect. The sharp edges
of November were tempered by a bright sun, and
the crisp air was possessed of a profound quiet.
When the pastoral stretches ended in the woods,
David stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been just about here,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
reminiscently, as he hitched the horse to a tree
and held out his hand to Carey. They walked on
into the depths of the woods until they came to
a fallen tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us sit here,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>She obeyed in silence.</p>
<p>An early frost had snatched the glory from
the trees, whose few brown and sere leaves hung
disconsolately on the branches. High above them
was an occasional skirmishing line of wild
ducks. The deep stillness was broken only by
the scattering of nuts the scurrying squirrels
were harvesting, by the cry of startled wood
birds, or by the wistful note of a solitary, distant
quail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember that other&ndash;&ndash;that first day
we came here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She glanced up at him quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this really the place where we came and
you told me stories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were only six years old,&#8221; he reminded
her. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that you should
remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time I had ever been in any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
kind of woods,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;and it was the
first time I had ever played with a grown-up boy.
For a long time afterward, when I teased mother
for a story, she would tell me of &#8216;The Day Carey
Met David.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you remember nothing more about
that day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; you made us some little chairs out
of red sticks, and you drew me here in a cart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you remember when you first laid eyes
on me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;yes, I remember. You drove a funny
old horse, and I saw you coming when I was waiting
at the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you were at the gate,&#8221; he echoed, with
a caressing note in his voice. &#8220;You were dressed
in white, as you are to-day, and that was my first
glimpse of the little princess. And because she
was the only one I had ever known, I thought of
her for years as a princess of my imagination
who had no real existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But afterwards,&#8221; she asked wistfully, &#8220;you
didn&#8217;t think of me as an imaginary person, did
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you were hardly a reality until&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until the convention?&#8221; she asked disappointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; before that. It was in South America,
when I began to write my book, that you came
to life and being in my thoughts. The tropical
land, the brilliant sunshine, the purple nights, the
white stars, the orchids, the balconies looking
down upon fountained courts, all invoked you.
You answered, and crept into my book, and while
we&ndash;&ndash;you and I&ndash;&ndash;were writing it, it came to me
suddenly and overwhelmingly that the little princess
was a living, breathing person, a woman who
mayhap would read my book some day and feel
that it belonged to her. It was so truly hers that
I did not think it necessary to write the dedication
page. And she did read the book and she
did know&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down into her face, which had grown
paler but infinitely more lovely.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, I didn&#8217;t dare know. I wanted to
think it was so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey,&#8221; his voice came deep and strong, his
eyes beseeching, &#8220;we were prince and princess in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
that enchanted land of childish dreams. Will
you make the dream a reality?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;When, David,&#8221; she asked him, &#8220;did you know
that you loved, not the little princess, but me,
Carey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You make the right distinction in asking me
when I <i>knew</i> I loved you. I loved you always,
but I didn&#8217;t know that I loved you, or how much
I loved you, until that night we sat before the fire
at the Bradens&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, David, tell me what mother said that day
after the parade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me I had her consent to ask you&ndash;&ndash;this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why, David, did you wait until to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge that you were coming back
here to Maplewood brought the wish to make a
reality of another dream&ndash;&ndash;to meet you at the
place where I first saw you&ndash;&ndash;to bring you here,
where you clung to me for the protection that is
henceforth always yours. And now, Carey, it is
my turn to ask you a question. When did you
first love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That first day I met you&ndash;&ndash;here in the woods.
My dream and my prince were always realities
to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:70px;;'>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>The governor was indulging in the unwonted
luxury of solitude in his private
sanctum of the executive offices. The long line
of politicians, office seekers, committees, and reporters
had passed, and he was supposed to have
departed also, but after his exit he had made a
detour and returned to his private office.</p>
<p>Then he sat down to face the knottiest problem
that had as yet confronted him in connection
with his official duties. An important act of the
legislature awaited his signature or veto. Various
pressing matters called for immediate action,
but they were mere trifles compared to
the issue pending upon an article he had read in
a bi-weekly paper from one of the country districts.
The article stated that a petition was
being circulated to present to the governor,
praying the pardon and release of Jud Brumble.
Then had begun the great conflict in the
mind of David Dunne, the &#8220;governor who could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
do no wrong.&#8221; It was not a conflict between
right and wrong that was being waged, for Jud
had been one to the prison born.</p>
<p>David reviewed the series of offenses Jud had
perpetrated, punishment for which had ever
been evaded or shifted to accomplices. He recalled
the solemn promise the offender had
made him long ago when, through David&#8217;s efforts,
he had been acquitted&ndash;&ndash;a promise swiftly
broken and followed by more daring transgressions,
which had culminated in one enormous
crime. He had been given the full penalty&ndash;&ndash;fifteen
years&ndash;&ndash;a sentence in which a long-suffering
community had rejoiced.</p>
<p>Jud had made himself useful at times to a
certain gang of ward heelers and petty politicians,
who were the instigators of this petition,
which they knew better than to present themselves.
Had they done so, David&#8217;s course would
have been plain and easy; but the petition was
to be conveyed directly and personally to the
governor, so the article read, by the prisoner&#8217;s
father, Barnabas Brumble.</p>
<p>By this method of procedure the petitioners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
showed their cunning as well as their knowledge
of David Dunne. They knew that his sense of
gratitude was as strong as his sense of accurate
justice, and that to Barnabas he attributed his
first start in life; that he had, in fact, literally
blazed the political trail that had led him from
a country lawyer to the governorship of his
state.</p>
<p>There were other ties, other reasons, of which
these signers knew not, that moved David to
heed a petition for release should it be presented.</p>
<p>Again he seemed to see his mother&#8217;s imploring
eyes and to hear her impressive voice. Again
he felt around his neck the comforting, chubby
arms of the criminal&#8217;s little sister. Her youthful
guilelessness and her inherent goodness had
never recognized evil in her wayward brother,
and she would look confidently to &#8220;Davey&#8221; for
service, as she had done in the old days of country
schools and meadow lanes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he, David Dunne, had
taken a solemn oath to do his duty, and his duty
to the people, in the name of justice, was clear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
He owed it to them to show no leniency to Jud
Brumble.</p>
<p>So he hovered between base ingratitude to
the man who had made him, and who had never
before asked a favor, and non-fulfillment of
duty to his people. It was a wage of head and
heart. There had never been moral compromises
in his code. There had ever been a right
and a wrong&ndash;&ndash;plain roads, with no middle course
or diverging paths, but now in his extremity he
sought some means of evading the direct issue.
He looked for the convenient loophole of technicality&ndash;&ndash;an
irregularity in the trial&ndash;&ndash;but his
legal knowledge forbade this consideration
after again going over the testimony and evidence
of the trial. The attorney for the defense
had been compelled to admit that his client had
had a square deal. If only the petition might be
brought in the usual way, and presented to the
pardon board, it would not be allowed to reach
the governor, as there was nothing in the case
to warrant consideration, but that was evidently
not to be the procedure. Barnabas would come
to him and ask for Jud&#8217;s release, assuming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
naturally that his request would be willingly
granted.</p>
<p>If he pardoned Jud, all the popularity of the
young governor would not screen him from the
public censure. One common sentiment of outrage
had been awakened by the crime, and the
criminal had been universally repudiated, but it
was not from public censure or public criticism
that this young man with the strong under jaw
shrank, but from the knowledge that he would be
betraying a trust. Gratitude and duty pointed
in different directions this time.</p>
<p>With throbbing brain and racked nerves he
made his evening call upon Carey, who had come
to be a clearing house for his troubles and who
was visiting the Bradens. She looked at him to-night
with her eyes full of the adoration a young
girl gives to a man who has forged his way to
fame.</p>
<p>He responded to her greeting abstractedly,
and then said abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey, I am troubled to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it before you came, David. I read
the evening papers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he exclaimed in despair. &#8220;It&#8217;s true,
then! I have not seen the papers to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She brought him the two evening papers of
opposite politics. In glowing headlines the
Democratic paper told in exaggerated form the
story of his early life, his humble home, his days
of struggle, his start in politics, and his success,
due to the father of the hardened criminal.
Would the governor do his duty and see that
law and order were maintained, or would he
sacrifice the people to his personal obligations?
David smiled grimly as he reflected that either
course would be equally censured by this same
paper.</p>
<p>He took up the other journal, the organ of
his party, which stated the facts very much as
the other paper had done, and added that Barnabas
Brumble was en route to the capital city
for the purpose of asking a pardon for his son.
The editor, in another column, briefly and firmly
expressed his faith in the belief that David
Dunne would be stanch in his views of what
was right and for the public welfare.</p>
<p>There was one consolation; neither paper had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
profaned by public mention the love of his boyhood
days.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do! What should I do!&#8221; he
asked himself in desperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you will do,&#8221; said Carey,
quickly reading the unspoken words.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do, as you always do&ndash;&ndash;what you
believe to be right. David, tell me the story of
those days.&#8221;</p>
<p>So from the background of his recollections
he brought forward vividly a picture of his early
life, a story she had heard only from others. He
told her, too, of his boyish fancy for Janey.</p>
<p>There was silence when he had finished. Carey
looked into the flickering light of the open fire
with steady, musing eyes. It did not hurt her
in the least that he had had a love of long ago.
It made him but the more interesting, and appealed
to her as a pretty and fitting romance in
his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so hard, either way, David,&#8221; she
said looking up at him in a sympathetic way.
&#8220;To follow the dictates of duty is so cold and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
cruel a way, yet if you follow the dictates of
your heart your conscience will accuse you. But
you will, when you have to act, David, do what
you believe to be right, and abide by the consequences.
Either way, dear, is going to bring
you unhappiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you believe the right way, Carey?&#8221;
he asked, looking searchingly into her mystic
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she replied helplessly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know! The more I think about it, the more complicated
the decision seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed the matter at length, and he
went home comforted by the thought that there
was one who understood him, and who would
abide in faith by whatever decision he made.</p>
<p>The next day, at the breakfast table, on the
street, in his office, in the curious, questioning
faces of all he encountered, he read the inquiry
he was constantly asking himself and to which
he had no answer ready. When he finally
reached his office he summoned his private
secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Major, don&#8217;t let in any more people than is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
absolutely necessary to-day. I will see no reporters.
You can tell them that no petition or
request for the pardon of Jud Bramble has been
received, if they ask, and oh, Major!&#8221;</p>
<p>The secretary turned expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Barnabas Brumble comes, of course he is
to be admitted at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the morning the messenger to the
governor stood at the window of the business
office, idly looking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dollars to doughnuts,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly
and confidently, &#8220;that this is Barnabas
Brumble coming up the front walk!&#8221;</p>
<p>The secretary hastened to the window. A
grizzled old man in butternut-colored, tightly
buttoned overcoat, and carrying a telescope bag,
was ascending the steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you think so,&#8221; said the
secretary resentfully to the boy. &#8220;Barnabas
Brumble isn&#8217;t the only farmer in the world.
Sometimes,&#8221; he added, pursuing a train of
thought beyond the boy&#8217;s knowledge, &#8220;it seems
as if no one but farmers came into this capitol
nowadays.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>A few moments later one of the guards ushered
into the executive office the old man carrying
the telescope. The secretary caught the infection
of the boy&#8217;s belief.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; he asked courteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see the guvner,&#8221; replied the old
man in a curt tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; asked the secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barnabas Brumble,&#8221; was the terse response.</p>
<p>He had not read the newspapers for a week
past, and so he could hardly know the importance
attached to his name in the ears of those
assembled. The click of the typewriters ceased,
the executive clerk looked quickly up from his
papers, the messenger assumed a triumphant
pose, and the janitor peered curiously in from
an outer room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come this way, Mr. Brumble,&#8221; said the secretary
deferentially, as he passed to the end of
the room and knocked at a closed door.</p>
<p>David Dunne knew, when he heard the knock,
to whom he would open the door, and he was
glad the strain of suspense was ended. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
when he looked into the familiar face a host of
old memories crowded in upon his recollection,
and obliterated the significance of the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas!&#8221; he said, extending a cordial
hand to the visitor, while his stern, strong
face softened under his slow, sweet smile. Then
he turned to his secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Admit no one else, Major.&#8221;</p>
<p>David took the telescope from his guest and
set it on the table, wondering if it contained the
&#8220;documents in evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your coat, Uncle Barnabas. They
keep it pretty warm in here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I callate they do&ndash;&ndash;in more ways than one,&#8221;
chuckled Barnabas, removing his coat. &#8220;I hed
to start purty early this mornin&#8217;, when it was
cool-like. Wal, Dave, times has changed! To
think of little Dave Dunne bein&#8217; guvner! I
never seemed to take it in till I come up them
front steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I don&#8217;t seem to take it in myself,
but <i>you</i> ought to, Uncle Barnabas. You
put me here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>As he spoke he unlocked a little cabinet and
produced a bottle and a couple of glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I do declar, ef you don&#8217;t hev things as
handy as a pocket in a shirt! Good stuff, Dave!
More warmin&#8217; than my old coat, I reckon, but
say, Dave, what do you s&#8217;pose I hev got in that
air telescope?&#8221;</p>
<p>David winced. In olden times the old man
ever came straight to the point, as he was doing
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is it, Uncle Barnabas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it!&#8221; directed the old man laconically.</p>
<p>With the feeling that he was opening his coffin,
David unstrapped the telescope and lifted
the cover. A little exclamation of pleasure
escaped him. The telescope held big red apples,
and it held nothing more. David quickly
bit into one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know from just which particular tree these
come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;from that humped, old one in
the corner of the orchard nearest the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; allowed Barnabas, &#8220;that&#8217;s jest the one&ndash;&ndash;the
one under which you and her allers set and
purtended you were studyin&#8217; your lessons.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>David&#8217;s eyes grew luminous in reminiscence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten the tree&ndash;&ndash;or her&ndash;&ndash;or the
old days, Uncle Barnabas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed you hadn&#8217;t, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again David&#8217;s heart sank at the confidence in
the tone which betokened the faith reposed, but
he would give the old man a good time anyway
before he took his destiny by the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go through the capitol?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I be goin&#8217;. The feller that brung me up here
sed he&#8217;d show me through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you through,&#8221; said David decisively,
and together they went through the places
of interest in the building, the governor as proud
as a newly domiciled man showing off his possessions.
At last they came to the room where
in glass cases reposed the old, unfurled battle
flags. The old man stopped before one case
and looked long and reverently within.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was your regiment, Uncle Barnabas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-seventh Infantry. I kerried that air
flag at the Battle of the Wilderness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>David called to a guard and obtained a key
to the case. Opening it, he bade the old man
take out the flag.</p>
<p>With trembling hands Barnabas took out the
flag he had followed when his country went to
war. He gazed at it in silence, and then restored
it carefully to its place. As they walked away,
he brushed his coat sleeve hastily across his
dimmed eyes.</p>
<p>David consulted his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s luncheon time, Uncle Barnabas. We&#8217;ll
go over to my hotel. The executive mansion is
undergoing repairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want more&#8217;n a lunch, Dave! I ain&#8217;t et
nuthin&#8217; sence four o&#8217;clock this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that you get enough to eat,&#8221; laughed
David.</p>
<p>In the lobby of the hotel a reporter came
quickly up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, governor?&#8221; he asked, with his
eyes fastened falcon-like on Barnabas.</p>
<p>David returned the salutation and presented
his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brumble from Lafferton?&#8221; asked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
reporter, with an insinuating emphasis on the
name of the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the old man in surprise. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t seem to reckleck seein&#8217; you before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never met you, but I have heard of you.
May I ask what your business in the city is, Mr.
Brumble?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man gave him a keen glance from beneath
his shaggy brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I don&#8217;t know as thar&#8217;s any law agin
your askin&#8217;! I came to see the guvner.&#8221;</p>
<p>David, with a laugh of pure delight at the
discomfiture of the reporter, led the way to the
dining room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as foxy as ever, Uncle Barnabas.
You routed that newspaper man in good
shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what he was! I didn&#8217;t know but
he was one of them three-card-monty sharks.
Wal, I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s his trade to ask questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnabas&#8217; loquacity always ceased entirely at
meal times, so his silence throughout the luncheon
was not surprising to David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave,&#8221; he said as he finished, &#8220;ef this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
is your lunch I&#8217;d hate to hev to eat what you&#8217;d
call dinner. I never et so much before at one
settin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go over to the club now and have a
smoke,&#8221; suggested David. &#8220;Then you can go
back to my office with me and see what I have to
undergo every afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the club they met several of David&#8217;s friends&ndash;&ndash;not
politicians&ndash;&ndash;who met Barnabas with courtesy
and composure. When they returned to
David&#8217;s private office Barnabas was ensconced
comfortably in an armchair while David listened
with patience to the long line of importuners,
each receiving due consideration. The last interview
was not especially interesting and Barnabas&#8217;
attention was diverted. His eyes fell on
a newspaper, which he picked up carelessly. It
was the issue of the night before, and his own
name was conspicuous in big type. He read
the article through and returned the paper to its
place without being observed by David, whose
back was turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave,&#8221; he said, when the last of the
line had left the room, &#8220;I used ter think I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
ruther do enything than be a skule teacher, but
I swan ef you don&#8217;t hev it wuss yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>David made no response. The excitement of
his boyish pleasure in showing Uncle Barnabas
about had died away as he listened to the troubles
and demands of his callers, and now the recollection
of the old man&#8217;s errand confronted him
in full force.</p>
<p>Barnabas looked at him keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;&#8217;t ain&#8217;t no snap you
hev got! I never knowed till to-day jest what it
meant to you. I&#8217;m proud of you, Dave! I
wish&ndash;&ndash;I wish you hed been my son!&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor arose impetuously and crossed
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have been, Uncle Barnabas, if she
had not cared for Joe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Dave, but you hev a sweet little
gal who will make you happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s face lighted in a look of exquisite
happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, Uncle Barnabas. We will go to see
her this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see her, sartain. Hain&#8217;t seen her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
sence the night you was elected. And, Dave,&#8221;
with a sheepish grin, &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to git spliced
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? No! May I guess, Uncle Barnabas&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Rhody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, you air a knowin&#8217; one. Yes, it&#8217;s her!
Whenever we set down to our full table I got to
thinkin&#8217; of that poor little woman a-settin&#8217; down
alone, and I&#8217;ve never yet knowed a woman livin&#8217;
alone to feed right. They allers eat bean soup
or prunes, and call it a meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am more glad than I can tell you, Uncle
Barnabas, and I shall insist on giving the bride
away. But what will Penny think about some
one stepping in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, I&#8217;ll allow I wuz skeered to tell
Penny, and it tuk a hull lot of bracin&#8217; to do it,
and what do you suppose she sed? She sez, &#8216;I&#8217;ve
bin wantin&#8217; tew quit these six years, and now,
thank the Lord, I&#8217;ve got the chance.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what in the world did she want to
leave for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll be surprised when I tell you.
To marry Larimy Sasser!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Larimy! She&#8217;ll scour him out of
house and home,&#8221; laughed David.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hev both weddin&#8217;s to the same time.
Joe and Janey are a-comin&#8217;, and we&#8217;ll hev a
grand time. I hain&#8217;t much on the write, Dave,
and I&#8217;ve allers meant to see you here in this
great place. Some of the boys sez to me: &#8216;Mebby
Dave&#8217;s got stuck on himself and his job by this
time, and you&#8217;ll hev to send in yer keerd by a
nigger fust afore you kin see him,&#8217; but I sez,
&#8216;No! Not David Dunne! He ain&#8217;t that kind
and never will be.&#8217; So when I go back I kin tell
them how you showed me all over the place, and
tuk me to eat at a hotel and to that air stylish
place where I wuz treated like a king by yer
friends. I&#8217;ve never found you wantin&#8217;, Dave,
and I never expect to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas,&#8221; began David, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly failed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Dave! I didn&#8217;t know nuthin&#8217;
about that,&#8221; pointing to the newspaper, &#8220;until
a few minutes ago. I sed tew hum that I wuz
a-comin&#8217; to see how Dave run things, and ef
them disreptible associates of Jud&#8217;s air a-gittin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
up some fool paper, I don&#8217;t know it! Ef they
do send it in, don&#8217;t you dare sign it! Why, I
wouldn&#8217;t hev that boy outen prison fer nuthin&#8217;.
He&#8217;s different from what he used to be, Dave.
He got so low he would hev to reach up ter touch
bottom. He&#8217;s ez low ez they git, and he&#8217;s dangerous.
I didn&#8217;t know an easy minute fer the
last two years afore he wuz sent up, so keep him
behind them bars fer fear he&#8217;ll dew somethin&#8217;
wuss when he gits out. Don&#8217;t you dare sign no
petition, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears of relief sprang into the strong eyes of
the governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dave,&#8221; said the old man in shocked
tones, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t go fer to think fer a minute
I&#8217;d ask you to let him out cause he wuz my son?
Even ef I hed a wanted him out, and Lord knows
I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;d not ask you to do somethin&#8217; wrong,
no more&#8217;n I&#8217;d bring dishoner to that old flag
I held this mornin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>David grasped his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Barnabas!&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice broke with emotion. Then he murmured:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to see <i>her</i>, now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>As they passed out into the corridor a reporter
hastened up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor,&#8221; he asked, with impudent directness,
&#8220;are you going to pardon Jud Bramble?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before David could reply, Barnabas stepped
forward:</p>
<p>&#8220;Young feller, thar hain&#8217;t no pardon ben asked
fer Jud Brumble, and what&#8217;s more, thar hain&#8217;t
a-goin&#8217; to be none asked&ndash;&ndash;not by me. I come
down here to pay my respecks to the guvner, and
to bring him a few apples, and you kin say so
ef you wanter!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Carey came into the library where her
two callers awaited her, one glance into the
divine light of David&#8217;s deepening, glowing eyes
told her what she wanted to know.</p>
<p>With a soft little cry she went to Barnabas,
who was holding out his hand in welcome.
Impulsively her lips were pressed against his
withered cheek, and he took her in his arms
as he might have taken Janey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Carey!&#8221; he said delightedly, &#8220;Dave&#8217;s
little gal!&#8221;
